Five senior members of the World Cup-winning US football team have filed a complaint against the national federation for wage discrimination, foreign media reports.
The five are Alex Morgan, Carli Lloyd, Megan Rapinoe, Becky Sauerbrunn and Hope Solo, who complained that they get less than half of what is paid to their male counterparts.
However, the US Soccer Federation said it was disappointed, given the work it had done in building the women's game.
"We are the best in the world, have three World Cup Championships, four Olympic Championships, and the USMNT [men's team] get paid more just to show up than we get paid to win major championships," said Solo.
