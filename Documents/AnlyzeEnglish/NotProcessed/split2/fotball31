Leicester City has won the Premier League title in one of the greatest sporting stories of all time.
Tottenham's 2-2 draw at Chelsea on Monday confirmed a stunning achievement for Claudio Ranieri's side.
Leicester started the campaign as 5,000-1 outsiders for the title after almost being relegated last season.
They had lost just 3 league games in what has been described as a "fairytale" and the "most unlikely triumph in the history of team sport".
