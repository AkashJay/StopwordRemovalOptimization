Chelsea striker Diego Costa was given the red card when he clashed with Everton midfielder Gareth Barry at the FA Cup in Goodison Park.
A Chelsea spokesman told foreign news, "Diego spoke to club officials and expressed regret over his reaction to the challenge from Barry that led to his red card.
"But Diego was also very clear that he did not bite him at any point during that altercation."
Chelsea manager Guus Hiddink claims Everton deliberately provoked Costa, who had a running battle with Barry throughout the tie.
