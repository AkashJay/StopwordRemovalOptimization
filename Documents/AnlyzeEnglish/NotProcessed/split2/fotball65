Two goals from Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann secured a 2-0 semi-final victory for France against world champions Germany in Marseille to confirm a final against Portugal at the Stade de France on Sunday.
The French overcame Germany at a major tournament for the first time since 1958 to claim their place in the final.
Deschamps, who captained France to World Cup glory in 1998, admitted that his team were forced to battle all the way against the Germans.
"We found it tough but we didn't give up," Deschamps said. "There is quality in this German team and when they don't have the ball it gets even more complicated. We had the best team in the world opposite us.
"But before we came to the stadium we saw people going crazy ­- they are going to be even crazier on Sunday."
Deschamps made a bold selection by leaving N’Golo Kante out of the team following the Leicester City midfielder’s one-match suspension.
But the decision to stick with Blaise Matuidi and Paul Pogba in midfield proved key before Griezmann made the difference with a first-half penalty and second-half strike, which took his tournament tally to six goals.Watch the highlights below..
