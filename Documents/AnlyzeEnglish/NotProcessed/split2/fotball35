Jose Mourinho has signed his contract to become the new manager of Manchester United.
The Portuguese concluded talks at a central London hotel last evening, agreeing to succeed Louis van Gaal as the new boss at Old Trafford.
The Portuguese will replace van Gaal, who was sacked on Monday; two days after United won the FA Cup.
The BBC reported on Saturday, within an hour of United’s 2-1 win over Crystal Palace that Van Gaal would be sacked and Mourinho was set to replace him.
Discussions, which started on Tuesday and were delayed by negotiations over Mourinho’s image rights, finally finished yesterday.
An official announcement from the club is expected today. The 53-year-old is likely to sign a three-year contract.
