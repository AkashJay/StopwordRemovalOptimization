The Melbourne Renegades stayed alive in the 6th edition of the Big Bash League, finally knocking out the struggling Adelaide Strikers with a 6 run win.
Asked to bat at the Adelaide Oval, in the T20 cricket league, the Renegades set a decent total of 171 for the loss of 9 wickets, built around Marcus Harris' dominant innings of 85.
No other batsman really got going, Callum Ferguson the next best with 26, though all of the top 5, got starts.
