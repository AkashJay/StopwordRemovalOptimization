Cristiano Ronaldo has played down fears over his fitness ahead of Real Madrid's Champions League final against Atletico MadridÂ on Saturday after the three-time World Player of the Year limped off towards the end of training yesterday.
Ronaldo will aim to break his own record of 17 Champions League goals in a season in Milan, having already netted 16 in the competition so far this campaign.
His 17th two years ago came in the final against Atletico as Real ran out 4-1 winners after extra-time.
