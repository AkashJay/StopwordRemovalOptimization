Prosecutors in Brazil are recommending that football star Neymar be charged over four counts of fraud in relation to a tax case prior to his transfer to Barcelona in 2013.
It is alleged that companies were set up as fronts in order for the striker to pay a lower rate of tax.
Officials in Brazil say the allegations against the Barcelona striker cover a seven-year period from 2006.
The allegations are separate from a case heard in Spain on Tuesday.
Neymar appeared in court in Madrid in connection with fraud allegations surrounding his transfer. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing.
