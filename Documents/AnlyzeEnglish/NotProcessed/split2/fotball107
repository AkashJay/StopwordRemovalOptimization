Cristiano Ronaldo continued his sensational start to the World Cup with the winner as Portugal knocked Morocco out of the tournament. All eyes at the Luzhniki Stadium were on the Real Madrid star after his hat-trick in Portugal's opening game with Spain and, typically, he did not disappoint. It took the captain only four minutes to make his mark in the way Morocco had feared, diving to get on the end of a Joao Moutinho cross and planting an unstoppable header into the net. Ronaldo's goal put the European champions briefly top of Group B and extended his lead as the top scorer in Russia in the race for the Golden Boot. Spain's 1-0 win over Iran, means they top the group courtesy of having collected fewer disciplinary points than Portugal. Morocco, who last week failed in their bid to host the 2026 World Cup, became the first team to be eliminated from this one with one Group B game to go - but they did not go down without a fight.
