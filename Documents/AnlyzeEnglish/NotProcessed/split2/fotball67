Portugal overcame the early loss of Captain Cristiano Ronaldo to beat hosts France 1 to 0 in the Euro 2016 final yesterday.
This is their first win in a major tournament, thanks to substitute Eder's superb extra-time strike.
Real Madrid forward Ronaldo was carried off in tears in the 25thÂ minute at Paris' Stade de France, eight minutes after injuring his knee in a clash with France's Dimitri Payet.
