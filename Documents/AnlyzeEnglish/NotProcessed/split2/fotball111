France won the World Cup for the second time by beating Croatia 4-2 in a tremendous final in Moscow.
A breathtaking encounter featured the first World Cup final own goal, two hugely controversial refereeing decisions andÂ a goalkeeping howler.
France's victory meant Didier Deschamps, who captained them to glory in 1998, became just the third man to win the competition as a player and coach.
Croatia started brightly but France scored with their first attack as Mario Mandzukic headed Antoine Griezmann's controversially awarded free-kick into his own net.
As in all their previous knockout games, Croatia pulled level, this time through a well-taken goal from Ivan Perisic.
Just 10 minutes later France led again after Perisic was adjudged to have deliberately handled Blaise Matuidi's flick-on - but only after referee Nestor Pitana consulted the video assistant referee.
Griezmann converted the spot-kick, and France took control as Paul Pogba curled in a superb third and Kylian Mbappe stroked home to become the second teenager to score in a World Cup final.
A horrendous mistake from goalkeeper Hugo Lloris gave Croatia hope, as his misplaced pass hit Mandzukic and rolled in, but France held firm.
