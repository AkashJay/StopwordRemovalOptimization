Barcelona sealed their 24th La Liga title as Luis Suarez took his tally for the season to 59 goals with a hat-trick in a 3- nil win at Granada to hold off Real Madrid's late-season surge.
Suarez's treble also sees him become the first player in seven years other than Ronaldo and Barca teammate Lionel Messi to win the Pichichi award for La Liga's top goalscorer with 40.
Barca had seemed set to cruise to the title until a run of three consecutive defeats for the first time in 13 years last month.
