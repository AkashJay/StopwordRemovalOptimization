Holders Barcelona suffered a shock Champions League exit as Antoine Griezmann's double sent Atletico Madrid into the semi-finals.
Barca arrived in Spain's capital with a 2-1 advantage from the first leg but poor defending allowed the unmarked Griezmann to power home Saul's cross.
Saul headed against the bar as Barca toiled before Griezmann scored a late penalty after Andres Iniesta handled.
Barca were denied a penalty when Gabi handled just inside the area.
