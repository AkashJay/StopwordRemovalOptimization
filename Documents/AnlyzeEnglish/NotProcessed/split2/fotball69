FIFA president Gianni Infantino is to be interviewed by ethics investigators following allegations he breached the governing body's code of ethics.
According to foreign media reports that, the Infantino will meet Robert Torres, a member of the investigatory chamber of the FIFA ethics committee.
The interview in Zurich - possibly as early as Friday - is part of a preliminary probe.
If there is sufficient evidence then a full investigation could be opened.
Under such circumstances Infantino could be suspended from his role for up to 90 days.
The allegations relate to a possible conflict of interest when using private jets laid on by a World Cup-bidding country; that he filled senior posts without checking people's eligibility for the role; and billing Fifa for mattresses, flowers, an exercise machine and personal laundry.
