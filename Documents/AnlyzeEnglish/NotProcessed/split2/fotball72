The Nigeria Football Federation has confirmed Salisu Yusuf as the Super Eagles' chief coach as it continues the search for a technical adviser.
Paul Le Guen and the NFF failed to agree terms for the Frenchman to take the role, despite an announcement from the country's football federation.
The Frenchman had been named by the Nigerian Football Federation, which said he would work alongside Yusuf.
But the two parties could not come to a deal over a contract.
It is unclear how the two roles are to be defined but former Nigeria coaches Clemens Westerhof and Jo Bonfrere both had the official title of technical adviser.
The federation's executive committee met today and approved the appointment of Yusuf, who was caretaker coach for friendly wins against Mali and Luxembourg in May.
