Manchester United are to hold a service at Old Trafford marking 60 years since the Munich air crash which killed most of the Busby Babes.
The club is sending invites to season ticket holders over 65 but said all supporters will be welcome.
Turnstiles will open at 13:45 GMT on 6 February for an event with readings and poems, beginning at 14:45.
A minute's silence will be held at 15:04, marking the time of the fatal plane crash.
Twenty-three people were killed in the disaster, including eight United players and three club officials.
Seven of the players were killed immediately in the crash, with the club's rising star Duncan Edwards dying 15 days later in hospital.
Club legend Sir Bobby Charlton, who was 20 at the time, suffered head injuries in the crash while manager Sir Matt Busby was so badly hurt he was given the last rites by a Roman Catholic priest.Eight players perished in the 1958 crashSir Bobby Charlton survived the crashClub captain Roger Byrne was one of eight players killed by the crashFans will also honour the dead before the United's home game on 3 February
