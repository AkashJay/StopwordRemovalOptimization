Fifa has provisionally suspended its president Sepp Blatter, secretary general Jerome Valcke and vice-president Micheal Platini for 90 days.
The punishments were handed out by the ethics committee of football's world governing body, which is investigating the three over corruption allegations.
It also banned ex-Fifa vice-president Chung Mong-joon for six years.
Issa Hayatou, who heads Africa's football confederation (Caf), will act as Fifa president during Blatter's ban.
Uefa - European football's governing body - gave Platini its "full confidence" and said it "saw no need" to replace its current president while he is suspended from all football duties.
Platini - and Chung - are still hoping to replace Blatter at the top of Fifa when he steps down as president in February.
Hayatou, meanwhile, has issued a statement saying he will only serve on an interim basis and will not be standing for election.
Blatter, Platini and Valcke are banned from any football activity in the interim. They deny any wrongdoing.
