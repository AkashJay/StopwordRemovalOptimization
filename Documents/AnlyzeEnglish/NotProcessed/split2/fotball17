Manchester City's 3-1 victory over Everton to clinch a spot in the Capital One Cup final.
Manchester City's win over Everton was marred by serious-looking injury to Kevin De Bruyne.
Manuel Pellegrini's men came from behind to seal their spot in the Capital One Cup final after a 4-3 aggregate victory over the Toffees to set a Wembley date with Liverpool next month.
However, City have been left sweating over De Bruyne after he was stretchered off in the closing stages with a knee problem.
The Belgian helped turn the tie on its head after coming off the bench at the start of the second half, scoring one and setting up the other for Sergio Aguero.
However, De Bruyne collapsed in a heap after a challenge of Ramiro Funes Mori in the Everton box and boss Pellegrini will be keeping his fingers crossed the injury to the Â£54million summer signing is not serious.
The 24-year-old, who has scored in every round, is now a major doubt to be ready for the final.
But Pellegrini has played down fears De Bruyne is out for the season.
