Argentina and Barcelona forward Lionel Messi retired from international duty after missing in a penalty shootout as Chile won the Copa America final.
"For me the national team is over. I've done all I can, it hurts not to be a champion," Messi said.
The 29-year-old was making his 112th appearance for Argentina since making his debut in 2005.
After the match finished 0-0 in 120 minutes, Chile won 4-2 on penalties for their second consecutive Copa title.
Messi has not won a major international honour apart from a gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Argentina were beaten 1-0 in the 2014 World Cup final by Germany and he has now lost three Copa America finals (2007, 2015, 2016).
Messi's penalty miss on Sunday was Argentina's first attempt in the shootout, ballooned over the bar after Sergio Romero had denied Chile's Arturo Vidal.
Lucas Biglia also missed from 12 yards, with Chilean substitute Francisco Silva scoring the decisive spot-kick.
Messi has scored 55 goals in 112 appearances for the national team.Click below to watch the video...
