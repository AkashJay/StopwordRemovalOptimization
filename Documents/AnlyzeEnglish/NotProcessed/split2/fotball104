"The night was about Cristiano. He is relentless in his pursuit of greatness. What he is doing on the world stage is ridiculous."
Match of the Day pundit Rio Ferdinand said he "couldn't breathe" as former Manchester United team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick, including an 88th-minute equalizer, as Portugal drew 3-3 with Spain in a classic World Cup encounter.
This was Ronaldo's 51st hat-trick for club and country, a "personal best" according to the man himself.
It comprised his 82nd, 83rd, and 84th international goals, putting him joint-second on the all-time list alongside Hungary legend Ferenc Puskas, now trailing only Iran's Ali Daei on 109.
