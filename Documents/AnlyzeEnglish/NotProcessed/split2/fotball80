Slovacko striker Francis Kone came to the aid of the opposition goalkeeper on Sunday after Bohemians 1905 shot-stopper Martin Berkovec collided with his own defender Daniel Krch in the Czech First League.The sickening collision saw both players lying prone on the ground afterwards and despite the referee signalling to the sidelines for immediate medical attention, Kone ensured Berkovec didn't swallow his tongue in order to keep his air passage unobstructed.His quick thinking has been roundly praised but it's not the first time Kone has done something similar during a match.Speaking afterwards he said: "It has been four times, once in Thailand and twice in Africa. I'm always checking the players, to make sure they have not swallowed their tongue."
