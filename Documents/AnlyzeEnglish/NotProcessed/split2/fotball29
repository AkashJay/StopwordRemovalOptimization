The principal shareholder of Paris St-Germain is in talks to buy a stake in David Beckham's Miami Major League Soccer franchise.
Miami Beckham United (MBU), the ownership vehicle behind the proposed MLS team, has been seeking a financial partner for some time.
But sources close to the proposed deal say Qatar Sports Investment are just one of many interested groups.
Ex-England captain Beckham ended his playing career with PSG in 2012-13.
He will remain heavily involved in the project in the event of any sale.
Beckham has strong links to Qatar and recently defended its right to host the 2022 World Cup, along with Russia in 2018.
He said in December: "Whether it's corrupt or not, those countries have been chosen.
"People need to get behind that. It's all about bringing football to new countries. I think they should stick with it."
MBU have struggled to find a suitable site to build a stadium but are aiming to join the MLS in 2018, foreign media reports.
