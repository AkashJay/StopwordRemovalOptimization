The UK's ambassador has said following a series of clashes between football fans that a number of British people are in hospital in France.
Violence has broken out between England fans, rival supporters and police for three days in the French port city.
There were also clashes in the stadium following England's 1-all Euro 2016 draw with Russia, after Russian fans appeared to rush at England supporters.
