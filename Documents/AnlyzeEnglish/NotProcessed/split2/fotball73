Tributes have been paid to the Chapecoense players who died in a plane crash in Colombia on the final day of the Brazilian football season.
The LaMia plane ran out of fuel and crashed near Medellin, killing 71 people, including most of the team.
In stadiums across Brazil, fans from all the top division clubs held pictures of the players killed and sang Chapecoense's traditional chants.
