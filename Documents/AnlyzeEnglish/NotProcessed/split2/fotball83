Neymar will earn 865,000 euros a week when the Brazil forward completes his world record move from Barcelona to Paris St-Germain.
The 25-year-old's wages will equate to 45m euros a year before tax.
Barcelona have told the French club they must pay his 222m euro fee "in full" and they are understood to be ready to meet his release clause.
