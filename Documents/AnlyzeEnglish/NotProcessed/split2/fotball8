Real Madrid president Florentino Perez says he has not spoken to Cristiano Ronaldo about his future, but will do so after the Confederations Cup.
Ronaldo, 32, is said to want to leave Spain after being accused of tax fraud.
The forward, with the Portugal squad in Russia, signed a new five-year contract in November 2016, but has been linked with a return to Manchester United.
"The only thing I can say is Cristiano Ronaldo is a Real Madrid player," said Perez, who was re-elected on Monday.
