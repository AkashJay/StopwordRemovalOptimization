On the greatest night in its football history, Wales swept past the world's No. 2-ranked team at the European Championship on Friday.
Wales stormed back from a rough start to beat Belgium 3-1 in a pulsating quarterfinal won by classy goals from two unheralded forwards.
As usual, Gareth Bale was excellent and, of course, all the talk will be of him and Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo before the two teams meet in a semifinal next week.
The two most expensive players in soccer history. Real Madrid teammates. Stars on overachieving teams at Euro 2016.
Still, unlike Portugal, Wales and Bale have been wonderful and a truly refreshing surprise in reaching a first semifinal at a major tournament.
