Cristiano Ronaldo caused the internet to implode by scoring arguably his best ever goal with a bicycle kick in an emphatic 3-0 win for Real Madrid over Juventus in the Champions League. Ronaldo opened the scoring in the third minute with a clinical finish to give Madrid an early lead. Before the home side gained in confidence and ended the first half the stronger of the two sides. Ronaldo then conjured up some magic with a sensational bicycle kick on the edge of the Juventus box that flew past a helpless Gianluigi Buffon. The goal ironically left Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane - the man who scored arguably the competition's greatest goal - speechless along the sideline. "You can say he's one of the most beautiful players in the history of football," said Zidane.
