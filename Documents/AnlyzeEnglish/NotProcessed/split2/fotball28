Suspended Uefa president Michel Platini arrived at his appeal hearing on Monday saying that he is fighting not for his future but "against injustice".
Platini, 60, was banned for eight years by the world governing body's ethics committee in December, as was President Sepp Blatter.
Both were found guilty of breaches surrounding a Â£1.3m ($2m) "disloyal payment" to Platini.
"I've done nothing and I'm not afraid of anything," said the Frenchman.
"If I had anything to reproach myself for, I would be hiding in Siberia in shame."
Blatter's appeal against his own ban is scheduled to be heard on Tuesday.
Like Platini, the Swiss denies any wrongdoing.
"Is it Blatter who put me in this situation? Not at all, he is in the same situation as me," added Platini.
"Someone pushed the button and I will try to find out who."
Uefa said last month that it will not hold an election for its presidency until Platini's appeals process has been concluded.
The Fifa appeals committee, which is chaired by Bermuda Football Association president Larry Mussenden, has the power to reduce, increase or overturn the ban.
