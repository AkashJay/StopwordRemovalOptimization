Fifa president Sepp Blatter is appealing against his 90-day ban from football's world governing body.
The 79-year-old Swiss has been suspended from all duties while Fifa's ethics committee is investigating corruption claims against its leader.
He was suspended yesterday along with secretary general Jerome Valcke and Vice-president Michel Platini.
All three deny any wrongdoing.
