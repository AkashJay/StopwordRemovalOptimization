Gianni Infantino was appointed the president of world footballâ€™s governing body Fifa, foreign media reported.
Infantino, a lawyer from Brig in Valais of Switzerland, won a majority of votes at the elections held yesterday. He secured 115 votes succeeding Sheikh Salman al-Khalifa who won 88 votes.
He was voted to replace Sepp Blatter who was suspended from football for six years for breaching ethical guidelines.
Explaining about his success Infantino said, "I will work tirelessly to bring football back to Fifa and Fifa back to football. This is what we want to do.
"I feel a lot of emotion and have not realised yet what has happened today. It is still very fresh and it's been a long and exciting journey and I probably need some time to chill out and see what has happened."
