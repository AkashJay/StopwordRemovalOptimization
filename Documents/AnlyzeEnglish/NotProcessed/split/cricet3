Pakistan fast bowler Hasan Ali has a unique celebration after bagging a wicket. Many young cricketers are also imitating that post-wicket celebration. However, during Pakistan - Zimbabwe second One Day International at Bulawayo, Ali sustained a shoulder injury while performing his unique celebration after dismissing Zimbabwe's Ryan Murray. Although he completed his over, it was clearly seen that the fast bowler was in pain. The visitors won the game by nine wickets, which was played yesterday. Batting first, the home team made 194 all out in 49.2 overs. In reply, the visitors reached the target losing just one wicket off 36 overs. Fakhar Zaman remained unbeaten 117.
