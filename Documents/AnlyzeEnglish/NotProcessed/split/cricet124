Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan and Nurul Hasan have been fined 25% of their match fees and have received one demerit point for breaching ICC code of conduct.Shakib was found to have breached Article 2.1.1 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to “conduct that is contrary to the spirit of the game”, while Nurul was found guilty of violating Article 2.1.2, which deals with “conduct that brings the game into disrepute”.This was the first time one demerit point either player has had since the system came into effect on 22 September 2016.The incident involving Shakib happened in 19.2 over of the Bangladesh innings when he came to the edge of the boundary and gestured at his batsmen to come off the field while remonstrating against an umpiring decision.As regards Nurul, the reserve player argued and pointed finger at Sri Lanka captain Thisara Perera which led to unruly public behaviour after he was sent by the team on to the field of play to pass on a message to the two batsmen.On Saturday morning, both Shakib and Nurul pleaded guilty to the offences and accepted the sanctions proposed by Chris Broad of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees and, as such, there was no need for a formal hearing. rnrnrn rnrn Related Story:Bangladesh Players damage Player Dressing Room after last night's win (Photos & Video)
