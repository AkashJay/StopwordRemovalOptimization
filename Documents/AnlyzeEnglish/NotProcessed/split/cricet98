Indian Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (COA) has asked the Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) led by Neeraj Kumar to investigate match-fixing allegations against fast bowler Mohammed Shami. Shami’s wife Hasin Jahan has alleged that the pacer took money from a Pakistani girl named ‘Alishba’ after the insistence of an England-based businessman Mohammed Bhai. Indian media reported that COA has swung into action this morning (Mar. 14) and specifically asked former Delhi Police chief to pay attention to the alleged “audio recording” of the telephone conversation between Shami and his wife. In the wake of the allegations made by the cricketer’s wife, the BCCI has kept Shami’s contract on hold last week. Since contract issue has to be resolved, COA has requested ACSU to submit a report within the next seven days. COA has specifically asked Kumar to investigate Shami on three accounts. 1. The identity and antecedents of ‘Mohammad Bhai’ and ‘Alishba'. 2. Whether any money was in fact sent by the said Mohammad Bhai through the said Alishba to Md. Shami 3. If yes, the purpose for which the said money was received by Md. Shami.
