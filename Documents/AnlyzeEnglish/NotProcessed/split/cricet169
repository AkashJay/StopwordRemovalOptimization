South Africa have been dealt a huge blow with paceman Kagiso Rabada suspended for the final two matches of the ongoing Test series against Australia. Rabada was found guilty of deliberately making inappropriate contact with Australia captain Steve Smith on day one after an hour-long hearing with match referee Jeff Crowe at St Georgeâ€™s Park on Sunday night. Having been charged with a Level 2 breach of the ICC Code of Conduct, the 22-year-old was fined 50% of his match fee and handed three demerit points to take his total to eight, which equates to a two-Test ban. However, Cricket South Africa and Rabada have 48 hours to appeal the decision by the ICC, an option they are seeking legal counsel on whether to explore. If Rabada appeals he will remain suspended for the Cape Town Test unless a Judicial Commissioner is appointed early and hears an argument to allow him to complete whilst the hearing is being organized. After taking the wicket of Smith in the afternoon session on Friday, Rabada found himself in hot water when he brushed shoulders with the touring skipper as he moved to celebrate with his teammates. Crowe explained how he came to his decision in an ICC statement. "I found that there was contact between Rabada and Smith, and in my judgement, the contact by Rabada was inappropriate and deliberate," Crowe said. "He had the opportunity to avoid the contact, and I could not see any evidence to support the argument that the contact was accidental.
