Khaled Mahmud, Bangladesh cricket team's technical director, has refused to travel Sri Lanka as Manager in the upcoming Nidhas Trophy. BCB had chosen Courtney Walsh as the interim head coach while Mahmud was supposed to fulfill the duty of manager for the T20I tri-series. Disappointing result in the just concluded home series against Sri Lanka was citied as the major reason for bringing the changes in the team management. Mahmud had earlier refused to be associated with Bangladesh after their disappointing performance but later changed his mind saying he would continue to do so if the board ask him. Bangladesh will travel to Sri Lanka on tomorrow for the tournament, starting on 6th of March. They play their first fixture on 8th of March against India.
