Sri Lanka reached a commanding 504 for 3 at stumps on day 3 of the 1st Test against Bangladesh being played at Chittagong today (Feb. 02). Ashen Silva remained unbeaten on 87 and with him was Skipper Dinesh Chandimal on 37. They have so far added 89 runs for the 4th wicket. Sri Lanka began the 3rd days play on 187 for 1 with Dhananjaya de Silva and Kusal Mendis at the crease. Both of them dominated over the Bangladeshi bowlers and went on to make 173 and 196 respectively. Of the two wickets in the afternoon session, Dhananjaya's was the more forgivable. He top-edged a Mustafizur Rahman ball he was trying to pull from well outside off stump, and the keeper settled beneath the catch. The dismissal was some reward, too, for Mustafizur, who had bowled with excellent intensity all through this innings. De Silva also became the equal fastest Sri Lanka batsman to 1000 Test runs during his stay at the crease. Having once before been dismissed in the 190s - also against Bangladesh - Mendis tried to loft Taijul over the leg side once more, to score the four runs he needed for the milestone. He ended up only holing out, sending the ball high in the air, for Mushfiqur Rahim to complete an excellent catch, running full pelt from midwicket.
