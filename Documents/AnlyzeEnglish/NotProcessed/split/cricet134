New Zealand all-rounder Colin Munro has decided to skip red ball cricket in order to focus solely on the shorter-format career. He said that he gave up the longest format of the game as his "passion" for the traditional format had dimmed. "It would be fair to say that my focus hasn't been on four-day cricket this season and my passion for that format of the game isn't what it once was," Munro said. "I'm still 100% committed to playing for the Blackcaps and Auckland Aces in the shorter formats and have some big goals I'd like to achieve in the next couple of years. "Obviously with the World Cup next year I'd love to give myself the best chance of making that squad and that's where my main focus is," he added. In February this year, England's Adil Rashid and Alex Hales also decided to take up only white ball contracts with their respective counties.
