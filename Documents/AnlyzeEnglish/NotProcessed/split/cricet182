Concerning footage has emerged of Australian cricketer Cameron Bancroft allegedly putting a spoonful of sugar in his pocket during the Ashes. But England paceman Stuart Broad says he doesn’t believe the Australian cricket team tampered with the ball during the sides’ recent Ashes series and can’t understand why they’d resort to cheating at all. Following the incident which happened during Australia – South Africa third Test, the Australian captain Steve Smith temporarily stood down from his post along with his deputy David Warner. Meanwhile, ex-England captain Michael Vaughan was "pretty sure" Australia was ball-tampering during their 4-nil winter Ashes series victory. Australia opening batsman Cameron Bancroft admitted the offence during this week's Test loss to South Africa. Captain Steve Smith, who knew about the plan in advance, has been banned for one Test and stood down as skipper of his Indian Premier League team. However, he insisted it was "the first time this has happened". Vaughan, who captained England to an Ashes series victory on home soil in 2005, said that he was pretty sure it was going on throughout the Ashes series, but it was not the reason England lost 4 nil. He added that they still would have lost the series.
