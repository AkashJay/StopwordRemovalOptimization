The second Test between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh will start tomorrow in Mirpur, which is expected to help the spinners. Speaking to media ahead of the match, Bangladesh skipper Mahmudullah said they have a good chance to win the game as well as the series. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka skipper Dinesh Chandimal said that there will definitely be a result in the second Test. He said spinners will definitely come into play. Meanwhile, Rangana Herath needs only four more wickets to surpass Wasim Akram's tally of 414 and become the most successful left-armer in the history of Test cricket. Lahiru Kumara, who fielded poorly, in addition to being wayward with the ball in Chittagong, is likely to give way to Dushmantha Chameera - the other quick bowler in the Sri Lanka squad. There may be no other major changes. Sri Lanka (probable): 1 Dimuth Karunaratne, 2 Kusal Mendis, 3 Dhananjaya de Silva, 4 Dinesh Chandimal (capt), 5 Roshen Silva, 6 Niroshan Dickwella (wk), 7 Dilruwan Perera, 8 Rangana Herath, 9 Suranga Lakmal, 10 Lakshan Sandakan, 11 Dushmantha Chameera Sabbir Rahman is likely to pip Mosaddek Hossain as he appears to be a more aggressive option. Sunzamul Islam's place is still up for grabs, with Abdur Razzak being slightly ahead of Kamrul Islam and Nayeem Hasan, who could still get a chance. Bangladesh (probable): 1 Tamim Iqbal, 2 Imrul Kayes, 3 Mominul Haque, 4 Mushfiqur Rahim, 5 Liton Das (wk) , 6 Mahmudullah (capt), 7 Sabbir Rahman/ Mosaddek Hossain, 8 Mehidy Hasan Miraz, 9 Taijul Islam, 10 Abdur Razzak, 11 Mustafizur Rahman
