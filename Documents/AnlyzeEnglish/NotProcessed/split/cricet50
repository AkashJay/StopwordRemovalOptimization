Bangladesh has recalled batsman Sabbir Rahman for the second and final Test against Sri Lanka to be played in Dhaka from Thursday (Feb. 08). Sabbir lost his BCB contract on 1st of January after he was found guilty of assaulting a young fan during a first-class match in Rajshahi. Sabbir last played a Test match in October 2017, against South Africa in Bloemfontein which the hosts won by an innings and 254 runs. Meanwhile, regular skipper Shakib Al Hasan, who missed the series opener in Chittagong due to injury, will remain on the sidelines. Mahmudullah continues to lead the team in Shakib's absence.
