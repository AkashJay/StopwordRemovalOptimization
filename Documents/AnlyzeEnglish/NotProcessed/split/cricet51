Sri Lanka cricket selectors hopeful that fast bowler Lasith Malinga will be able to make a comeback for Nidhas Trophy T20 tri-nation series to be held in Sri Lanka next month. India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh will feature in the series. Lasith Malinga missed out on international cricket for close to two years due to a knee injury before making a comeback during Champions Trophy last June. Since his return, Malinga has featured in 13 ODIs and taken only 10 wickets at an average of 62. After a poor home series against India, he was dropped for the tours of UAE and India. However, he did reasonably well in T20Is since the injury, having taken 12 wickets in six games. However, his economy rate has been high at 8.25. "Once he plays domestic cricket we will consider him. We have sent a message not just to Lasith but all players to feature in domestic games. I know it is not ideal when we have a First Class tournament going on and you are considered a T-20 specialist. However, to be in the system, you have to feature in domestic cricket," Chief Selector Graeme Labrooy has said.
