Ben Stokes has been stripped of the England vice-captaincy for the Test series against New Zealand with James Anderson retaining the role he took on during the Ashes. Though the appointment is currently being made on a series-by-series basis it seems likely that Anderson will keep the job at least until the conclusion of Stokes' court case. Stokes' trial date, after his charge of affray to which he has pleaded not guilty following the incident in Bristol last September, has been set for 6th of August and is expected to last between five and seven days, meaning the all-rounder will miss the Lord's Test against India. Having removed the vice-captaincy from him in the current situation it is very unlikely he will be considered again until the outcome of the legal case is known and also the Cricket Disciplinary Commission process that will follow.
