From being a one-sided affair, the India-Bangladesh clash has become a more tightly fought contest. Having won three of their four matches in the Nidahas Trophy, India go into the final as favourites. This despite the absence of several key players, including captain Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni. India, however, will have to be wary of Bangladesh's 'tenacity', as wicketkeeper-batsman Dinesh Karthik said on the eve of the final.Bangladesh's batting has revolved around Mushfiqur Rahim and Mahmudullah, who both shepherded successful chases against Sri Lanka and put the hosts out of the tri-series. Tamim Iqbal and Liton Das have shown flashes of brilliance but the pressure continues to mount on Soumya Sarkar and Sabbir Rahman.Bangladesh's bowling, meanwhile, has been a mixed bag. Mustafizur Rahman is their leading wicket-taker with six wickets but it is Rubel Hossain who has looked more threatening. Offspinner Mehidy Hasan, on the other hand, has managed only one wicket in 15 overs.
