Australian opener Cameron Bancroft is expected to face a 'please explain' from the match referee in Cape Town, where former South Africa captain Graeme Smith has accused the Australian of ball tampering in the third Test. The opener was plunged into the middle of a ball-tampering drama late in the post-lunch session on day three at Newlands. Bancroft appeared to work on the ball with a small yellow item while in the field today (Mar. 24). "He's tampered with the ball and used an object to do that," Smith said on SuperSport. "It does look like it's a bit of sandpaper. The footage doesn't look good. I'm quite amazed the umpires haven't done anything with the ball. The footage is quite damning." Smith also implicated Australia's captain and coach in the drama. "If it is proved that what has gone on in the footage is correct then some tough questions have to be asked of Steve Smith and Darren Lehmann," he said.
