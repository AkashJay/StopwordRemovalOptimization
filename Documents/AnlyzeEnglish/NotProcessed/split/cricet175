Afghanistan legspinner Rashid Khan has become the quickest to reach the milestone of 100 ODI wickets. Khan took his 100th ODI wicket during his 44th ODI, he had West Indies' Shai Hope lbw for 23 with the last ball of his third over during yesterday’s final of ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier in Harare. The previous record was held by Australian left-arm pacer Mitchell Starc who broke an 18-year-old record in 2016. Aged 19, Rashid has been a hugely influential figure in the team’s rise from an Associate level team to a full member status. He took his 50th ODI wicket in his 26th match and moved to 99 in 17 more.
