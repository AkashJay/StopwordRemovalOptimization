After a lot of speculation, drama and an attempt to convince ODI skipper Mashrafe Mortaza to reconsider his T20 retirement, Bangladesh has named Shakib Al Hasan as captain for the tri-nation T20 International series to be held in Sri Lanka. The series also involves Sri Lanka and India starting on 6th of March in Colombo.
However, the BCB medical board has made it clear that Shakib won't be available for the opening two games of the tournament as he is still struggling with a sore finger.
Shakib sustained an injury to his left hand during the tri-nation ODI series final in January against Sri Lanka.
It is learnt that Shakib wasn't too keen to play on with the injury but BCB President Nazmul Hasan seems to have convinced him.
Bangladesh Squad for Nidahas trophy:
Shakib Al Hasan (c), Mahmudullah, Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Mushfiqur Rahim, Sabbir Rahman, Mustafizur Rahman, Rubel Hossain, Abu Jayed, Taskin Ahmed, Imrul Kayes, Nurul Hasan, Mehidy Hasan, Ariful Haque, Nazmul Islam, Abu Haider Rony
