Former Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh has called for a ban on Bangladesh cricketers from international cricket after their involvement in the final-over scuffle between its players and the Sri Lankan cricket team in the 6th T20I of the Nidahas Trophy T20 tri-series on Friday (Mar. 16). Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan had almost led his team to get disqualified from the Nidahas Trophy as tempers flew. Bangladesh was chasing 160 for victory and needed 12 runs from the last over. Isuru Udana bowled the final over for Sri Lanka and bowled a head-high bouncer on the first ball and followed up with another one. Then the Bangladeshi batsmen started to question the legality of the bowl, which led to a tense atmosphere in the ground. "It is the independence Cup...don't forget. The captain needs to set an example with the way he leads," felt former Indian cricketer Nikhil Chopra.
