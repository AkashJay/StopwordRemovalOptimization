Cricket Australia has launched an investigation into the incident after a CCTV footage emerged, showing Australian vice-captain David Warner involving in a heated argument with South African wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock. The incident occurred at tea on day four of the first Test yesterday (Mar. 04). The incident occurred after two intriguing cricketing sessions. Warner was one of the focal points during the day following his animated celebration after the run-out of AB de Villiers. Australia also had a tough second session. They had managed just one wicket between lunch and tea with de Kock and Aiden Markram forging a partnership that revived the hostsâ€™ bleak hopes of chasing down 417. And as the players left the field, emotions appeared to boil over. The footage showed Warner aggressively throwing verbal volleys at de Kock who was following the Australians up the steps. The Australian vice-captain was then held back from moving towards de Kock by Usman Khawaja and later Tim Paine. Captain Steven Smith then dragged his deputy in the dressing room, as de Kock headed towards his dressing room.
