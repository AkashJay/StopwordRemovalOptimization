Bangladesh Test skipper Shakib Al Hasan has been ruled out of the first Test against Sri Lanka, with a finger injury.Hee sustained the injury during the tri-series final in Mirpur today (Jan. 27). Shakib injured his left little finger which resulted in bruising and swelling, and there is even a chance of him missing the rest of the tour upto February 18, when Sri Lanka play a T20 in Sylhet. Mahmudullah will lead the Test side in Shakib's absence.Shakib sustained the injury in the 42nd over of the Sri Lanka innings when he attempted to run out Dinesh Chandimal. But as he swooped forward, he fell awkwardly on his left hand. Shakib writhed in pain before being taken off the ground to the hospital where he had an X-ray. BCB's senior physician Debashis Chowdhury said the X-ray report was clear but the injury required stitches.The first Test begins on January 31 in Chittagong and the second on February 8 in Mirpur.
