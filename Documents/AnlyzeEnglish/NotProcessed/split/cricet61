There were sixes aplenty as cricket took a tentative step into the world of winter sports with the Ice Cricket Challenge in the Swiss Alps. Many modern greats of the game faced off for a T20 match in the resort town of St. Moritz in temperatures below zero degrees. Australians Mike Hussey and Andrew Symonds were part of the action, while Virender Sehwag and Shahid Afridi captained the respective teams. Sehwag wasn't undone by the unusual conditions, hitting five sixes as he scored 62 while Symonds finished with 40 as Sehwag's XI finished with 9-164 from 20 overs. Former England international Owais Shah was the match-winner, however, hitting five sixes in his innings of 74 as Afridi's XI won the match with almost five overs to spare. Sri Lanka's Mahela Jayawardene and Tillakaratne Dilshan who played for Sehwag's side scored 7 and 8 runs respectively. Sehwag’s XI:
Virender Sehwag (c), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Mahela Jayawardene, Mike Hussey, Andrew Symonds, Mohammad Kaif, Joginder Sharma, Ramesh Powar, Ajit Agarkar, Zaheer Khan, Lasith Malinga Afridi’s XI:
