Sri Lanka has won the toss and elected to bat first in the second and final Test against Bangladesh at Mirpur.
Sri Lanka has also beefed up their batting order, and have dropped their two more aggressive options from the Chittagong Test.
Gone are wrist spinner Lakshan Sandakan and Lahiru Kumara from the XI. In their place, Akila Dananjaya, the offspinner has been handed a Test debut, while batsman Danushka Gunathilaka also enters the squad.
Bangladesh has made two changes to the XI that played the Chittagong Test, bringing in batsman Sabbir Rahman in place of the less-aggressive Mosaddek Hossain, and also opting for the experience of Abdur Razzak over Sunzamul Islam.
Razzak is playing his first Test in four years, soon after becoming the first Bangladeshi bowler to claim 500 first-class wickets.
