South Africa beat Australia by six wickets in the second Test in Port Elizabeth to level the 4-match series one all. Chasing 101 to win, the home team reached the target losing 4 wickets in the 4th day afternoon. Kagiso Rabada who picked up 11 wickets was the Man of the Match. Earlier in the day, Australia resumed with a lead of 41 but the wicket of Mitch Marsh exposed Australia's bowlers to a rampant Rabada, who quickly dismissed Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc to make it 11 for the match. After bowling Marsh for 45 with a searing off-cutter in the first over of the day, Rabada then had a diving Theunis de Bruyn in the gully to thank for the wicket of Cummins (five). He then had Starc caught behind to continue the one-man wrecking show, before news filtered through that he had been charged by the ICC for a second offence in the match - this time for a day three send-off of David Warner. Fellow quick Lungi Nigidi then had Nathan Lyon (five) edging through to Quinton de Kock for his fifth wicket of the match, leaving a defiant Tim Paine and No.11 Josh Hazlewood with the task of scrounging out a slightly larger lead. Paine's unbeaten 28 and Hazlewood's run-a-ball 17 took the lead to exactly 100 before the paceman attempted one swipe too many from Keshav Maharaj and was caught near the midwicket boundary. With that Australia were bundled out for 239 in their second innings. Australia made 243 in their first innings and in reply South Africa made 382.
