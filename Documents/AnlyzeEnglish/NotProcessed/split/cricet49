Australia’s veteran batsman Brad Hodge has announced his retirement from playing all forms of competitive cricket. 43-year-old Hodge was played for Melbourne Renegades but he had to miss the closing stages of the league due to appendicitis related issue. Hodge was hospitalized ahead of Renegades' clash against Sydney Thunder on January 24 where he had his burst appendix removed. Hodge has represented Australia in 6 Tests, 25 ODIs and 15 T20Is. He is deemed as a cricket giant in Australia’s first-class cricketing circle, amassing 17084 first-class runs in 223 matches at an average of 48.81, with 51centuries and 64 fifties.
