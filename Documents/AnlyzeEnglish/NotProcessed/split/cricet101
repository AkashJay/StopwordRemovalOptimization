Ben Stokes produced a superb all-round performance in his second match back in the England fold to help level the ODI series and New Zealand. He helped seal a reasonably straightforward chase of 224 with a crisp 63 off 74 balls to follow two sharp run-outs, as part of an outstanding fielding display, and a brace of wickets. Stokes and Captain Eoin Morgan added 88 in 15 overs to break the back of the chase in Mount Maunganui's first day-night ODI. Stokes, playing increasingly fluently, reached his fifty from 54 balls and gave a muted raise of the bat around the ground, before finishing the task alongside Jos Buttler, who clubbed 36 off 20 balls. They won with more than more than 12 overs to spare. Batting first, New Zealand totalled 223 all out with Mitchell Santer top scoring with 63 not out. Martin Guptill made 50. Moeen Ali and Ben Stokes bagged 2 wickets each. In reply, the visitors reached 225 for 4 off 37.5 overs. Stokes top scored with 63 and skipper Eoin Morgan made 62.
