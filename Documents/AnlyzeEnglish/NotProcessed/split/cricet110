Bangladesh will be boosted by the return of Shakib al Hasan for the ongoing T20I series in Sri Lanka. His arrival was confirmed on today (Mar 15). Shakib is expected to play in Bangladesh's crucial clash against Sri Lanka to be played tomorrow. Both teams have registered just one win from three games and the winner of this clash will take on India in the final on Sunday. Shakib's return will bolster the Bangladesh line-up, particularly the bowling attack which has looked weak in all three games. He will also take over the captaincy from Mahmudullah, who was filling in as T20I captain during the tournament. The all-rounder has recovered from the finger injury he picked up in the tri-series final against Sri Lanka at home earlier this year. During this time, he saw specialists in Thailand and Australia, before taking up gym and training sessions in Dhaka earlier this week.
