It was a tense game yet again, similar to that of the last over of the Nidahas Trophy thriller.
Peshawar Zalmi totalled 157 in their allotted 20 overs, Liam Dawson was the top scorer with 62 off 35 balls with six fours and 4 sixes.
Mohammad Hafeez also made 25 off 14 balls.
Interestingly, Thisara Perera and Mahmudulla who were part of an intense Nidahas Trophy game last Friday (Mar. 16) represented Quetta Gladiators.
They shared 3 wickets between them.
Chasing 158 to win, Quetta Gladiators managed to total 156 for 9 in their allotted 20 overs.
This is the last over of the match.
