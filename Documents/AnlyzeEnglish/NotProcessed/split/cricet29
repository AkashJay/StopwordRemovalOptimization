Bangladesh national cricket selectors have recalled veteran left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak to the squad for the first of the two-match Test series against Sri Lanka. The first Test begins at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chittagong on Wednesday (Jan. 31). Razzak is the third player to be added to the squad after Shakib Al Hasan was ruled out of the match with an injury sustained during the tri-series final on Saturday. Razzak recently became the first Bangladeshi bowler to take 500 first-class wickets and has been the standout performer in Bangladesh in the format in the last few years. The 35-year-old's inclusion increases the size of the squad to 16 members, with the selectors having earlier called up left-arm spinner Sunzamul Islam and leg-spinning all-rounder Tanbir Hayder.
