Sri Lanka skipper Thisara Perera says the failure of batsmen including himself was the main reason for the team's loss to India in Nidahas Trophy T20I at the Khettarama Stadium, yesterday. Perera will lead Sri Lanka next match too, which would be played against Bangladesh on Friday (Mar. 16). Speaking to the media after yesterday's loss, Thisara Perera said they will concentrate on rectifying the batting woes in the next game.
