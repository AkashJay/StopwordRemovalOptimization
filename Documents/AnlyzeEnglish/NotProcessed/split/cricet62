He is the work-horse in Sri Lanka's fast bowling unit. Nobody expected that Suranga Lakmal who is a product of Debarawewa Central in Hambantota would go such a long way when he was named in the Sri Lankan cricket squad way back in 2009. His first overseas tour was a nightmare. The Sri Lankan team was attacked by gunmen in Lahore. But it did not deter his determination. 30-year-old Lakmal made his Test debut in 2010 against West Indies in Colombo. The ongoing Test is his 44th Test. Yesterday, Lakmal became the fourth Sri Lankan fast bowler to bag 100 Test wickets. Chaminda Vaas (355), Lasith Malinga (101) and Dilhara Fernando (100) were the other Sri Lankan bowlers who had breached 100 Test-wicket-milestone. Suranga Lakmal dismissed Bangladeshi opener Tamim Iqbal for 4 as his 100th Test scalp. Here are some of the highlights of day one of Sri Lanka - Bangladesh 2nd Test being played at Mirpur.
