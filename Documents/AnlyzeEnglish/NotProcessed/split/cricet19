Sri Lanka will be confident and reinvigorated when they take on Bangladesh in the ODI Tri Series final at theÂ Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Dhaka today(Jan.27).
Having lost the first two encounters of the series, Sri Lanka bounced back with two consecutive victories.
Meanwhile, the humbling defeat will act as a good wake up call for Bangladesh, who rocked this tournament with three straight wins in their first three fixtures before the defeat.
