Former Australian fast bowler Doug Bollinger has announced his retirement from cricket today (Feb. 05). He was also a vital cog in the New South Wales state side. The 36-year-old played 12 Test matches, 39 One-Day Internationals and nine Twenty20 Internationals. Even though he had a brief Test career lasting less than two years, Bollinger enjoyed much success bagging 50 wickets at an average of 25.92. He also claimed 62 ODI scalps at 23.9. Bollinger made his First-Class debut in the 2002-03 season before playing his first Test in January of 2009 against South Africa in Sydney.
