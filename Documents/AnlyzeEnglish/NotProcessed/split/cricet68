Sri Lankan spinners outsmart Bangladeshi counterpartsThe curator at Mirpur may have prepared the pitch for the second Test thinking that home team's spinners would be able to throttle the Sri Lankan batsmen. However, the end result was quite the opposite. The 3-member Sri Lankan spin combination squeezed the home team's batsmen and they were bowled out for 110 and 123 runs in their respective innings. Akila Dananjaya was the main destroyed bagging 8 wickets for 44 runs in his debut match. Rangana Herath and Dilruwan Perera meanwhile shared 8 wickets between them in the match. Rangana Herath, who claimed 4 for 49 in the second innings of the home team in doing so, he became the most successful left-arm bowler in Test history. This was Bangladesh's first series defeat at home since 2015.
