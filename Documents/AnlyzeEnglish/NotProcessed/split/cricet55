He was first discarded by the national selectors and then by his franchise for the last decade. However, he's back again. This time with a different role. Here, we talked about Sri Lankan fast bowler Lasith Malinga. Now he has been named bowling mentor of Mumbai Indians ahead of IPL 2018. Malinga, who has had a long-standing association with the franchise, will join the support staff headed by his former captain Mahela Jayawardene. It also includes bowling coach Shane Bond, batting coach Robin Singh and newly appointed fielding coach James Pamment. This will be Malinga's first official mentoring role with any side. "It's a great opportunity to be present with, and an honour to continue my association with Mumbai Indians," Malinga was quoted as saying in a statement. In his long and distinguished international career, 34-year-old Malinga has featured in 30 Tests, 204 ODIs and 68 T20Is for Sri Lanka. He has also played 127 games for Mumbai Indians in the IPL and Champions League T20 and is the highest-wicket taker for the franchise with 179 scalps at an economy rate of 6.88. Recently, Sri Lanka's Chief Selector Graeme Labrooy said that Malinga would be considered for the upcoming Nidahas Trophy tri-nation ODI series to be held in Sri Lanka in March.
