Nepal has claimed ODI status for the first time with their six-wicket win over Papua New Guinea. Dipendra Singh Airee was front and centre on this historic occasion, claiming 4 for 14 to knock the opposition over for 114 and then leading the chase with a 58-ball half-century. Paras Khadka's men had to thank the Netherlands though, whose defeat of Hong Kong, meant that they will now be playing with the big boys. A team that was in Division Five in 2008, alongside Afghanistan, have now risen to the top-tier of international cricket. Papua New Guinea, who lost all four of their group games in the tournament prior to the consolation bracket loss to Nepal, have lost their ODI status along with Hong Kong. Both teams have now been demoted to WCL Division Two, but they do have one final chance to play an ODI (at least until 2020) - the ninth-place play-off tomorrow.
