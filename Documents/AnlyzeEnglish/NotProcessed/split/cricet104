Shakib Al Hasan has been ruled out of Bangladesh's Nidahas Trophy campaign, as he still hasn't recovered from his finger injury. Mahmudullah will continue to lead the Bangladesh T20 team in his absence while Liton Das has replaced him in the squad.Shakib injured the little finger on his left hand during the ODI tri-series final on January 27 and missed the Test and T20 series against Sri Lanka last month. He also didn't play in the Pakistan Super League.Last week the BCB picked a 16-man squad with Mehidy Hasan Miraz as Shakib's cover as the diagnosis till that point wasn't encouraging. Shakib also consulted two orthopedists in Bangkok, and it now seems that his recovery will take longer than expected.(Cricinfo)
