Royal Challengers Bangalore have drafted in New Zealand all-rounder Corey Anderson as a replacement for Australia fast bowler Nathan Coulter-Nile for IPL 2018. Coulter-Nile, the second highest wicket-taker for Kolkata Knight Riders last season is yet to recover from a stress fracture to his back and hasn't played any form of cricket since October 2017. He was bought at the auction in February for $ 338,300 approximately. Anderson, who was part of Delhi Daredevils in 2017, went unsold at the 2018 auction. Anderson's signing gives RCB a number of overseas all-round options. They already have England's Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes, and New Zealand's Colin de Grandhomme in their roster.
