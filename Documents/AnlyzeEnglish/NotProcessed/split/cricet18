Imrul Kayes has been added to Bangladesh's squad for the tri-series final against Sri Lanka to be played tomorrow (Jan. 27). Imrul had been excluded from the team for Bangladesh's third and fourth matches. He struck a first-class century in the BCL in that period. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka's stand-in captain Dinesh Chandimal said that everything went well according to the plan when they beat Bangladesh comprehensively in the final league match. After the match, he said it was a complete team effort. Suranga Lakmal decked the Bangladesh middle order, Thisara Perera swung blows in the middle, Dushmantha Chameera and Lakshan Sandakan wiped out the tail, and a hail of sixes carried Sri Lanka's openers to a paltry target of 83. All up, Sri Lanka required only 35.5 overs to complete the 10-wicket win - 24 overs to dismiss the opposition and 11.5 to run down their score.
