The fifth match of the Nidahas Trophy T20 International series between India and Bangladesh will be played at the Khettarama Stadium in Colombo today (Mar. 14). A win for India will secure their place in the final. However, if the Bangladeshis record a win here, the tri-nation series will be wide open. Then the finalists will be decided based on Sri Lanka - Bangladesh match to be played on 16th of this month. Rain continues to be forecast in Colombo, and the pitch is likely to remain the same, mostly batting-friendly. India made only one change in the previous game, replacing Rishabh Pant with KL Rahul, and barring any last-minute injuries, they are likely to go with the same XI. India (probable):
1 Rohit Sharma (capt), 2 Shikhar Dhawan, 3 KL Rahul, 4 Suresh Raina, 5 Manish Pandey, 6 Dinesh Karthik (wk), 7 Vijay Shankar, 8 Washington Sundar, 9 Yuzvendra Chahal, 10 Shardul Thakur, 11 Jaydev Unadkat Bangladesh is unlikely to change their winning line-up but there are strong question marks next to Sabbir Rahman and Taskin Ahmed after the Sri Lanka game.
Ariful Haque and Abu Jayed could be options to consider. Bangladesh (probable):
1 Tamim Iqbal, 2 Soumya Sarkar, 3 Liton Das, 4 Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), 5 Mahmudullah (capt), 6 Sabbir Rahman/Ariful Haque, 7 Mehidy Hasan, 8 Mustafizur Rahman, 9 Taskin Ahmed/Abu Jayed, 10 Rubel Hossain, 11 Nazmul Islam
