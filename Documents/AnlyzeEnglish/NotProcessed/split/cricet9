Sri Lanka Cricket selectors are in a desperate situation to name their squad for the upcoming West Indies tour as several leading players are nursing with injuries. Angelo Mathews, Suranga Lakmal, Nuwan Pradeep, Dushmantha Chameera, Asela Gunaratne, Shehan Madushanka and Kusal Janith are among them. Mathews and Lakmal, the captains of Kandy and Galle respectively, have already missed two of the 3 games of the Inter-Provincial tournament, conducted by Sri Lanka Cricket. While Mathews is recovering from a calf injury that he picked up ahead of the Nidahas Trophy, Lakmal pulled out of Galle's first game of the Inter-Provincial tournament with a side strain. Wicketkeeper-batsman Kusal Perera, the highest run-getter in the Nidahas Trophy, is also nursing a hamstring injury and has not played any part in the Inter-Provincial tournament. While Pradeep and Madushanka are ruled out of the tour of West Indies, Chameera is racing against time in order to be fit. Mathews, Lakmal and Perera are expected to turn up for their respective teams in the last round of Inter-Provincial tournament next week.
