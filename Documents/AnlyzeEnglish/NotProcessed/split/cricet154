South African opening batsman Dean Elgar equalled a world record when he carried his bat through a completed innings for the third time.
Starting the day on 121 not out, he remained 141 not out as his team was bowled out for 311 on the second day of the third Test against Australia today (Mar. 23).
Only Desmond Haynes of the West Indies had previously batted unbeaten through a Test innings on three occasions.
Australian captain Steve Smith also equalled a world record when he caught South Africa's last two batsmen for a total of five catches in the innings, the joint-most by a fielder.
Although ten other fielders shared the record, Smith was only the second Australian to achieve the feat after Vic Richardson in 1935/36.
