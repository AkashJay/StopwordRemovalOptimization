Northamptonshire will welcome back Sri Lankan leg-spinner Seekkuge Prasanna for the entirety of this year's NatWest T20 Blast. The 32-year-old, who took 12 wickets in 10 matches for Northants in 2016, will link up with the county ahead of their opener against Leicestershire on July 4. Northamptonshire head coach David Ripley said: 'We're delighted to have Seeku back for the 2018 season. Prasanna, who has featured in one Test, 38 one-day and 20 Twenty20 internationals, was re-signed by Northants last season but a hamstring injury ruled him out of the sprint format competition.
