It was a day that England cricketers will be eager to forget. In the first day of Auckland Test, the Englishmen were bowled out for 58 in their first innings against New Zealand. Despite this bad experience, the players had something to cheer about. The reason, Stuart Broad, was able to become the youngest fast bowler to reach 400 Test wickets. Broad had Tom Latham for 26 as his 400th Test wicket. He was 31 years, 271 days when he achieved the milestone today (Mar. 22). Broad has picked up 196 wickets in a span of four years between 2013 and 2016. It is the most by any bowler in that period. He averaged 25.56 and took a wicket every 52 balls in that period.
