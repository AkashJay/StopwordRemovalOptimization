The 3rd match of the Nidahas Trophy will be played between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh at Colombo tonight (Mar. 10), at 7 pm.
Bangladesh has lost 13 of their last 14 T20Is and will need to resolve their batting issues, particularly their difficulty in rotating the strike to give a good fight to the hosts, who have already beat India.
However, Sri Lanka's fast bowling coach Rumesh Ratnayake said that they will be taking Bangladesh seriously, and will continue to play smart cricket.Sri Lanka (probable): 1 Danushka Gunathilaka, 2 Kusal Mendis, 3 Kusal Perera, 4 Dinesh Chandimal (capt & wk), 5 Upul Tharanga, 6 Dasun Shanaka, 7 Thisara Perera, 8 Jeevan Mendis, 9 Akila Dananjaya, 10 Dushmantha Chameera, 11 Nuwan Pradeep / Suranga Lakmal Bangladesh (probable): 1 Tamim Iqbal, 2 Soumya Sarkar, 3 Liton Das, 4 Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), 5 Mahmudullah (capt), 6 Sabbir Rahman, 7 Mehidy Hasan, 8 Mustafizur Rahman, 9 Taskin Ahmed, 10 Rubel Hossain, 11 Nazmul Islam
