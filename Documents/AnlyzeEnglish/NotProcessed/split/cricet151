England was bowled out for 58, their sixth lowest Test total, on the first day of the Test series in New Zealand today (Mar. 22). Playing their first Test since losing the Ashes 4-0 in Australia, England were dismissed in 20.4 overs in an hour and 35 minutes at Eden Park, Auckland. They slipped to 27-9 before number nine Craig Overton's unbeaten 33 took them past their previous lowest total of 45. Trent Boult took 6-32 and Tim Southee 4-25 as five batsmen made ducks, equalling England's record. New Zealand reached 88-1 at dinner in the first-day night Test to be played in the country, with Captain Kane Williamson unbeaten on 59. Boult, in particular, and Southee capitalized on swinging conditions with the pink ball after New Zealand won the toss. But the technique of England's batsmen was horribly exposed, with Mark Stoneman the only other player to reach double figures. The tourists became only the fifth side to be bowled out in the first session of a Test. England's lowest Test totals 45 v Australia, Sydney, 1887
