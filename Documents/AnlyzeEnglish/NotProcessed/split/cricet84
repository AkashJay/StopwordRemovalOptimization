Sri Lanka's Head Coach Chandika Hathurusingha says that he never doubted the team's ability after starting off his new coaching job with two successive defeats during the tour of Bangladesh. Sri Lanka had suffered three 5 nil whitewashes in ODI cricket in 2017 and the team's struggles continued in 2018 as they started off the tri-nation competition in Bangladesh last month with defeats to Zimbabwe and the hosts. Hathurusingha cited good communication, tactical flexibility, and a relaxed environment as key elements in Sri Lanka sweeping every trophy on offer. Now, his concentration has shifted to cultivating a strong squad that can compete in various conditions. "We want a big pool of players for us to compete against different countries and different opposition, depending on their limitations and strengths," Hathurusingha said. "All the players get an equal opportunity and they will definitely know where they stand when it comes to selection. Sri Lanka lost captain Angelo Mathews to injury at the start of the Bangladesh tour, but the team bounced back by winning the tri-nation finals before winning the Test and T20I series to complete a successful tour. "With me, I don't think you will see the same team too often. Of course, the players that perform have the assurance of their places in the team, but will always try and see the best combination that can win games. It's not that we're trying to play with just eleven players for the next two years." Jeevan Mendis provided a prime example of this policy in action. Drafted in after three years out of the national setup, he had an immediate impact, picking up two wickets in his first over. Hathurusingha also said that he didn't feel that he had made the wrong choice in committing to Sri Lanka, despite the early setback because he knew that they could bounce back.
