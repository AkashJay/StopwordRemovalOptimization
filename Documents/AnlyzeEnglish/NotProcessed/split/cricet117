West Indies spinner Sunil Narine has once again been reported for a suspect bowling action. He was reported during the Pakistan Super League game between Lahore Qalandars and Quetta Gladiators on 14th of March. This means he has been placed on the PSL's watch list, but can continue to play the tournament unless reported again. The PCB will pass on the match officials' report on Narine's action to Cricket West Indies (CWI). The West Indies off-spinner has had his action reported several times in the past. During the Champions League T20 in 2014, he was reported twice in two matches and missed the final. He pulled out of West Indies' World Cup 2015 squad to give himself time to work on his bowling action following that, returned during the IPL, and was reported once again during that tournament. After testing, his off-breaks were banned, but later in the tournament, he was given a "final warning" by the BCCI and struck off the watch list. He returned to international duty in November 2015, only to be reported once again during his first series back - limited-overs games against Sri Lanka. He was suspended from bowling - even while the No. 1 bowler in the ICC rankings for ODIs and T20Is - at the end of November, and missed the 2016 World T20 as well to work on his action. He was cleared to bowl again ahead of IPL 2016.
