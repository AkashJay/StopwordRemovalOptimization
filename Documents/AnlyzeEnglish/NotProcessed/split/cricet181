Australian skipper Steve Smith on Monday decided to step down from Rajasthan Royals’ captaincy in the wake of the severe backlash he has faced after admitting to ball tampering during the third Test against South Africa. India’s Test vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane will now lead the franchise in the upcoming 11th edition of Indian Premier League as Cricket Australia is mulling harsher sanctions despite a one-Test ban by the ICC. The decision was on expected lines the moment Cricket Australia indicated that harsher penalty was on cards for Smith and Co for their role in an episode that has shaken Australian sporting fraternity. Royals’ mentor and former skipper Shane Warne was in Cape Town and it is understood that Warne must have also had a chat with the Australian captain. Rajasthan Royals will launch their season with an away fixture against Sunrisers Hyderabad on 9th of April followed by their first home game in Jaipur on 11th of April against the Delhi Daredevils.
