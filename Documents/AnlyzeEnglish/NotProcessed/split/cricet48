An innings of a lifetime from Jake Weatherald helped Adelaide Strikers to their maiden BBL title. Strikers won the game by 25 runs. Weatherald clubbed Hobart Hurricanes to all parts of the Adelaide Oval, hitting eight sixes and nine fours in a stunning 115 from just 70 balls. Weatherald's maiden T20 hundred underpinned Strikers' monstrous total of 2 for 202 on a superb batting surface. The Hurricanes threatened early, courtesy a powerplay blitz from their captain George Bailey. However, Hurricanes were managed to reach 177 for 5 in their 20 overs.
