Bangladesh names squad for Sri Lanka Tests....Bangladesh Cricket Selectors have named their squad for the first Test against Sri Lanka to be played in Chittagong from 31st of this month. Under-19 off-spinner Nayeem Hasan is the surprise inclusion in the 14-man squad. Seventeen-year-old Nayeem is currently playing the Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand. His inclusion comes as a big surprise since Nayeem has played only four first-class matches and hasn't been mentioned in any selection conversations in the last few months. Chief selector Minhajul Abedin said that Nayeem will be returning from New Zealand to join the Test squad. The squad sees other major changes too. Shakib Al Hasan returned as captain after he was rested for the South Africa Tests last year while Mosaddek Hossain and Kamrul Islam were also recalled. Mosaddek was recovering slowly from an eye condition but he scored a century in the Bangladesh Cricket League first-class competition last week.
