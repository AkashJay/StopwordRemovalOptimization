The final match of Nidahas Trophy is scheduled to be played between India and Bangladesh tonight at the Khettarama Stadium.Meanwhile, President of Bangladesh Cricket Board, Nazmul Hasan has expressed regret at the series of incidents that led to a broken glass door in the dressing room at R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.
Bangladesh's tense two-wicket win over Sri Lanka in Friday's virtual semi-final of the Nidahas Trophy was an uneasy encounter full of heated drama, both on and off the field, culminating in a temporary stoppage of play in the final over.
The issue of the broken glass then added to the sour aftertaste of the match, which, from a cricketing point of view, had provided gripping action for nearly 40 overs.
Sri Lanka Cricket has officially lodged a complaint to Bangladesh Cricket Board regarding the broken glass incident.
