Sri Lanka Cricket says opener Kusal Mendis who sustained a leg injury during Sri Lanka's last match against Bangladesh on Monday (Mar. 12) is fit for Sri Lankaâ€™s last match to be played on Friday.
SLC's CEO Ashley de Silva confirmed that the situation of Kusal has improved and he would definitely play against Bangladesh.
Kusal Mendis scored back-to-back half-centuries in Sri Lanka's last 2 matches. However, Sri Lanka lost both the games.
