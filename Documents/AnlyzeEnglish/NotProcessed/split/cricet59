Sri Lankaâ€™s fast bowler Lasith Malinga says he will announce his retirement from international cricket as he is mentally done with international cricket. He made this revelation hours after being appointed as the bowling mentor of Mumbai Indians. "Mentally I am over with playing cricket. I don't think I will play anymore international cricket. I am planning to announce my retirement soon," Malinga has said on the sidelines of the St. Moritz Ice Cricket Challenge in Switzerland. "I have not spoken to Sri Lanka Cricket but once I go back I will have to again go through the domestic grind, see how my body responds. But now as my IPL career is also over and I am starting a new chapter with Mumbai Indians, I might not play again," he added. Malinga admitted that in his heart he knew that his time was up. "Everyone gets that signal. Even the great Wasim Akram knew when his time was up," he said. "I was not surprised at their decision not to have retained me. I had 10 very good years with Mumbai Indians and I achieved a lot. But this year, the owners spoke to me and told me about their vision going forward. They wanted to create a good team for the next three years. I also understand that my time in competitive cricket is over now." However, he said he is looking forward to the new chapter of his life as a mentor. "I am 34-years-old and not getting any younger. And I feel this is the right time to make a career move. Mumbai Indians had the mentorship role in mind and I am happy to start a new inning," said Malinga. "My job as a mentor will now give me an opportunity to guide the next crop of fast bowlers. I will pass on my knowledge to them and also it will be an opportunity to assess myself in the coaching arena," he further added.
