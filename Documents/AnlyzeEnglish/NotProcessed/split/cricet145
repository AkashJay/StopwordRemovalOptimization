The knock of Dinesh Karthik in the Nidahas Trophy final has brought back the discussion on MS Dhoni's position in India's T20 team. Over the past year or so, MS Dhoni's position in India's side has been a subject of discussion. Cricket analysts say Dhoni was not able to score as quickly as he once did, and, besides, there is no World T20 scheduled before 2020, by when Dhoni will be 39. Dhoni hit 52 off 28 balls in the second T20I in South Africa, temporarily killing the debate, but the decision to rest him from the Nidahas Trophy gave Dinesh Karthik an opportunity to show the value he can bring to the Indian side. He took India home twice, once with an unbeaten 39 in a league game against Sri Lanka and then in spectacular fashion in the final, perhaps reigniting thoughts of phasing Dhoni out of T20Is.
