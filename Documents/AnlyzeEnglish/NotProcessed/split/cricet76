India sets another record"India records first bilateral series win in South AfricaIndia has won their first bilateral series in South Africa across any format bar a one-off T20, with victory in the fifth ODI in Port Elizabeth.
Their success in the series has been fashioned by their wrist spinners, Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav, who have taken 30 out of the 43 South African wickets to fall in five matches, at an average of 13.63.
Chahal and Kuldeep shared six wickets between them at St George's Park, where India defended a below-par total in a messy effort in the field that still managed to force a South African collapse.
The hosts lost 6 for 31 to crash from 166 for 4 in the 35th over to being bowled out inside 43 overs and only have a win in a rain-shortened match in Johannesburg to show for their efforts.
