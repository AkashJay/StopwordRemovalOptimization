When opener Dimuth Karunaratne was dismissed by Mehidy Hasan in the third over of the Sri Lankan innings, everybody thought that a familiar sight to be unfolded, that's Sri Lanka would struggle to score runs in the Chittagong pitch. The score was 1 for 1. In the recent past, both Australia and England suffered defeats in similar style. The next in was Dhananjaya de Silva, the man who saved Sri Lanka from defeat against India a few months back. He found an abled-batsman at the crease in make-shift opener Kusal Mendis. The pair ensured Sri Lanka reached 187 for 1 at stumps on day 2 - Mendis was 83 not out and De Silva was 104 not out. It was 4th Test century for De Silva.
