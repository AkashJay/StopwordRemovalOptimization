The first T20 International between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh will be played at Dhaka and the game will begin at 4.30 pm. According to statistics, Sri Lankaâ€™s T20Is record has been dismal over the past 10 months, losing each of their eight most recent encounters. Bangladesh is ravaged by injuries, with Tamim Iqbal (bicep) and Mushfiqur Rahim (wrist) having picked up niggles to add to Shakib's finger injury. In any case, they have to make five changes to the XI that played in their most recent T20I in October. If Tamim is fit, he will open with Soumya Sarkar. Among the newcomers, Afif Hossain, Ariful Haque and either one of Nazmul Islam or Mahedi Hasan are likely to make their debuts. A late injury to Asela Gunaratne, who landed awkwardly on his arm during a fielding training, has ruled him out of the series. This means Kusal Mendis - originally sent as a replacement for the injured Kusal Perera - could come into the side. On the fast-bowling front, they are likely to field at least one of Shehan Madushanka and Asitha Fernando - both uncapped in this format. It is also unclear who might partner Akila Dananjaya in the spin attack - perhaps Amila Aponso, the left-arm spinner. Sri Lanka (probable):
1 Upul Tharanga, 2 Niroshan Dickwella (wk), 3 Kusal Mendis, 4 Danushka Gunathilaka, 5 Dinesh Chandimal (capt), 6 Thisara Perera, 7 Dasun Shanaka, 8 Akila Dananjaya, 9 Isuru Udana, 10. Amila Aponso, 11 Shehan Madushanka Bangladesh (probable):
1 Tamim Iqbal/Mohammad Mithun, 2 Soumya Sarkar, 3 Afif Hossain, 4 Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), 5 Sabbir Rahman, 6 Mahmudullah, 7 Ariful Haque, 8 Mohammad Saifuddin, 9 Mahedi Hasan/Nazmul Islam, 10 Mustafizur Rahman, 11 Rubel Hossain
