The Pakistan Super League launches its third edition in Dubai today (Feb. 22), adding a sixth team, more international stars and with hopes that the Twenty20 tournament can be staged entirely in Pakistan in future. The new Multan Sultans and the confirmation of a slew of international greats such as Shane Watson and Brendon McCullum have given a lift to fans eager to forget last year's spot-fixing scandal. And the decision to stage the three final matches of the PSL at home, in Lahore and Karachi, could pave the way for the entire tournament to be staged in Pakistan next year. The Sultans, bought by the Schon Group for $ 5.2 million is coached by legendary Pakistani paceman Wasim Akram and skippered by Shoaib Malik. On the batting bench, they have openers Ahmed Shehzad and Shan Masood, Kumar Sangakkara, Kieron Pollard and Multan's very own, Sohaib Maqsood. Leading the bowling will be Sohail Tanvir, Junaid Khan, Mohammad Irfan, Imran Tahir, and Umar Gul. They will take on defending champions Peshawar Zalmi in the opening match in Dubai.
