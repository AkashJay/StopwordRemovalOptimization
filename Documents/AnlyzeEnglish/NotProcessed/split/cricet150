Scotland's hopes of reaching the 2019 World Cup were effectively over after West Indies won a rain-affected game in Harare to qualify for the tournament. The World Cup Qualifier Super Sixes game was played at the Harare Sports Club, yesterday (Mar. 21). The Scots needed another 74 off 14.4 overs when the deluge intervened, Kyle Coetzer's side trailing by five runs on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) method. They had earlier bowled the Windies out for 198, Safyaan Sharif and Brad Wheal both taking three wickets. Richie Berrington hit 33 after Scotland were reduced to 25-3 in reply. But his controversial dismissal, given out lbw to a ball that replays appeared to show was heading down the leg side, proved costly as Scotland's hopes of a fourth World Cup appearance - after reaching the 1999, 2007 and 2015 tournaments - were ended by the weather. Two-time champions West Indies secure their spot at the 2019 tournament in England and Wales, having been forced to qualify after dropping out of the automatic ranking spots. Zimbabwe will take the second and final qualifying place if they beat UAE, who are already eliminated, today. A shock defeat for the hosts would see the winner of Ireland against Afghanistan tomorrow go through.
