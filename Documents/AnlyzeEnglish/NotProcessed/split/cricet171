In a bizarre chain of events the Pakistan Super League game between Lahore Qalandars and Karachi Kings moved into the Super Over. In the end, the Lahore Qalandars prevailed over Karachi Kings in a nail-biting finish. After Lahore had made 11 in the Super Over, Karachi was halted in their tracks by Sunil Narine, who unleashed his full complement of tricks. Conceding only two runs off the first five balls, which included the wicket of Colin Ingram, Narine all but ensured Karachi didn't provide one last twist in an encounter that wouldn't pause for a moment of calm. Earlier in the night, Lahore experienced the full spectrum of emotions - they came within shouting distance of wrapping up the game but then thought they stuffed it only to eventually tie the game. Needing 16 to win off the last over, Sohail Akhtar turned up and dialled up the adrenaline with a sequence of 2, 4 and 6 off Usman Khan. With four runs needed off three deliveries, Mitchell McClenaghan ran himself out in pursuit of a bye. With the equation eventually narrowing down to three off one, Akhtar hit one straight down the throat of long on. However, even as Karachi were celebrating, it emerged that Usman had overstepped. More drama ensued as the two batsmen - Akhtar and Gulraiz Sadaf - hadn't completed the run. Despite the ball being ruled dead with Ravi Bopara, the fielder, having completed the catch before the run was completed, the umpires Aleem Dar and Tim Robinson ruled that Sadaf would be on strike for the last ball. With two needed off the final delivery, Usman nailed his yorker and Sadaf could manage only one as the game went into the Super Over. Just over a week ago, Lahore found themselves on the wrong side of a Super Over. This time they would prove to be second-time lucky. Following the game was over, former Sri Lanka skipper Kumar Sangakkara tweeted seeking clarity.
