Darren Sammy hit 16 runs off the final over and ensure Peshawar Zalmi beat Quetta Gladiators by 5 wickets in a crucial Pakistan Super League encounter in Sharjah yesterday (Mar. 01). The Peshawar captain's heroics, hobbling out to bat on one leg, ensured he has taken pride of place on that shelf for the foreseeable future. Chasing 142, Peshawar had seemed on course for much of the innings, led by a disciplined - if a little sedate - 54-run partnership between Tamim Iqbal and Mohammad Hafeez. But with 35 required off the last five, the partnership was broken, and suddenly the chase went into disarray. The equation turned very quickly turned into 16 off the last 7 when Sammy, who was injured while bowling, dragged himself out to the crease. It turned out his devastating physical power was undiminished, as he smashed two sixes off his first two balls, before a straight drive in the final over saw Peshawar clinch victory with two balls to spare.
