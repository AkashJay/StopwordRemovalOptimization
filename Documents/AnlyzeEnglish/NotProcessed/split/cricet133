Mohammed Shami's name has been withheld from the official BCCI contracts list after his wife accused him of adultery and domestic violence. Shami was supposed to be awarded a Grade B contract, which comes with a retainer of $ 460,000, but the BCCI chose to wait for police proceedings. It is understood that Hasin Jahan, Shami's wife, had met the police after she first made the allegations on social media Tuesday night. Shami, currently in Dharamsala playing the Deodhar Trophy, tweeted on Wednesday morning that the news was "absolutely false" and a "conspiracy" to defame him and adversely affect his game. Earlier, in a bid to expose the pacer's extra-marital affairs, Hasin posted several screenshots of Messenger and Whatsapp messages on her unverified Facebook wall. Notably, the post, which was uploaded from an unverified account, was titled as 'Shami's enjoyment' and had several pictures of the pacer's text messages to multiple women. "I've done everything he wanted me to do. I left my modelling career, job and also did not step out of the house," Hasin said. She further alleged that Shami's family forced her to marry him and later also tried to kill her. "He was planning to abandon me after his South Africa tour by taking away the property and insurance papers. I have been tolerating all this for the past five years. He has been asking for the divorce for two years," she said. Hasin said Shami was only concerned with money and fame. "I'm not going to divorce him till my last breath. I've all evidence against him and will soon drag him to court," she said.
