Indian Cricket Board has granted permission to skipper Virat Kohli permission to play county cricket this summer, ahead of India's 5-match Test tour of England beginning in August.
The decision might mean that Kohli misses India's one-off Test against Afghanistan, which is scheduled between June 14 and 18 in Bengaluru.
It is not yet known which county Kohli might play for before he joins the India squad for the limited-overs leg of the England tour in July.
Though he has been linked to Surrey, the London-based County has not signed or held any talks with Kohli recently.
