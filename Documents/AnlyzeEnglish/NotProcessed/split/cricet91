Ravichandran Ashwin will captain Kings XI Punjab in the eleventh season of the Indian Premier League, the franchise announced today (Feb. 26). The 31-year-old off-spinner has never led an IPL side before. Ashwin takes over the reins from Glenn Maxwell, who was picked up by Delhi Daredevils at the auction. The Tamil Nadu spinner said he was looking forward to the challenge and tapping into the experiences of having captained his state-side in the domestic tournaments. Ashwin has played more than 100 games in the IPL, playing his first seven seasons for Chennai Super Kings and one for Rising Pune Supergiants. He missed the last season with an injury. Having made his debut in the 2009 season, Ashwin went on to become a crucial part of the CSK team, helping them win back-to-back titles in 2010 and 2011 and reach the final on three other occasions. He has a total of 100 wickets in 111 games, at an average of 25 and an economy of 6.55.
