Bangladesh pulled off a sensational 2 wicket victory over Sri Lanka under dramatic circumstances to set up a clash against India in the Nidahas Trophy T20I tri-series yesterday (Mar.16).
Mahmudullah who scored 43 not out, struck a stunning 6 in the penultimate delivery to reach the target of 160.It led to the wild celebration of the Bangladesh team after tempers were frayed due to debatable decisions from the umpires.
The match at the Khettarama Stadium was marred by drama toward the end of the virtual semi-final as Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan gestured to his two batsmen to come out of the field apparently in protest against a seemingly shoulder-high ball, arguing that it should have been called a no-ball.
Later a Bangladesh substitute who had come on to the field with drinks had become embroiled in an argument with the Sri Lankan players.
Meanwhile, a window of the visitors' dressing room was found damaged after Bangladesh's tense run chase against Sri Lanka. rnrnrnrn rnrnrnrnrnrn
