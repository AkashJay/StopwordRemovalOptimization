In the wake of the ball-tampering controversy that hit the Australian Cricket during the third Test against South Africa, there have been speculations that the Indian Premier League franchises Rajasthan Royals and Sunrisers Hyderabad will sack Steve Smith and David Warner as their respective captains. IPL Chairman Rajeev Shukla says that it is a matter of serious concern and they are awaiting ICC's decision before deciding the fate of the tainted Australia duo. Meanwhile, reports also state that Steven Smith and David Warner will face anything up to a life ban for cheating under Cricket Australia's code of behaviour. Consequently, the Board of Cricket Australia has endorsed Tim Paine to step in as Acting Captain for the remainder of this Test. Eventually, Australia lost the match by 322 runs.
