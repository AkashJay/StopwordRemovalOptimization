Afghanistan's Rashid Khan will become the youngest captain in the history of international cricket when he takes the reigns for the start of their World Cup Qualifier campaign in Zimbabwe this weekend. Afghanistan has confirmed that Rashid will replace regular skipper Asghar Stanikzai, who will miss the start of the tournament after he was forced to undergo surgery for appendicitis. He is expected to be out of action for 10 days. Rashid will be 19 years and 165 days for their opening match on Sunday, when he will become the first teenager to captain a men's international side and the youngest player ever, male or female, to captain in a full international match. Former Bangladesh skipper Rajin Saleh holds the current ODI record having led his country in 2004 at the age of 20 years and 297 days.
