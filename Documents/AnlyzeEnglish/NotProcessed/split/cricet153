Indian cricket board has renewed the contract of fast bowler Mohammad Shami after clearing him of charges levelled by his estranged wife. Shami's contract was put on hold after Hasin Jahan accused him of corruption, domestic violence and adultery. He has denied all the allegations against him. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said an internal investigation had cleared Shami of the corruption charges made against him. His contract gives him $ 460,200 a year. He will also be free to represent his team, the Delhi Daredevils, at the Indian Premier League (IPL) tournament which is due to start in April. The BCCI did not mention the other charges made against the cricketer when it announced the decision to reinstate his contract.
