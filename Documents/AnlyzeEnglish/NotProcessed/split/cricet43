Young, new batsman Roshen Silva scored his maiden Test century in the 1st Test against Bangladesh at Chittagong.Sri Lanka's score was 528 for 3 in the first innings a short while ago, lead by 15 runs.Bangladesh only scored 513 runs for their first inning.Roshen Shivanka Silva is one of Sri Lanka's most consistent domestic batsmen.His challenge has been to stand out. Though often one of the best batsmen in any first-class season, Silva has rarely been the top-scorer, nor the batsman who appears most naturally gifted among the domestic lot. But eventually the piles of runs he had accrued began to pique the national selectors' interest.Roshen is a proud product ofÂ St. Joseph's College in Maradana.rn
