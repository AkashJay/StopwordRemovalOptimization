Australia beat New Zealand by 19 runs (D/L method) in the final of the tri-nation T20 International series at Auckland today (Feb. 21). Batting first, New Zealand totalled 150 for 9 after taking the first lease of the wicket. Martin Guptill made 21 while Colin Munro scored 29 off 14 balls. However, Ashton Agar unsettled the Kiwi middle order bagging three quick wickets and at one stage the home team was on 93 for 6. Then Ross Taylor making 43 not out held the innings together. Agar captured 3 for 27 while Kane Richardson and Andrew Tye bagged 2 wickets each. In reply, Australia reached 121 for 3 in 14.4 overs when rain stopped play. D'Arcy Short capped an excellent debut series by crunching his second T20I fifty off 30 balls. David Warner made 25 while Glenn Maxwell was unbeaten on 20 when the match came to an end. With this win, Australia improved their position to second in the ICC rankings - a remarkable turnaround, given they started the month languishing at No. 7.
