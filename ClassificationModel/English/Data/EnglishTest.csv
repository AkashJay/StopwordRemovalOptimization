"Bangladesh pulled off a sensational 2 wicket victory over Sri Lanka under dramatic circumstances to set up a clash against India in the Nidahas Trophy T20I tri-series yesterday (Mar.16).
Mahmudullah who scored 43 not out, struck a stunning 6 in the penultimate delivery to reach the target of 160.It led to the wild celebration of the Bangladesh team after tempers were frayed due to debatable decisions from the umpires.
The match at the Khettarama Stadium was marred by drama toward the end of the virtual semi-final as Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan gestured to his two batsmen to come out of the field apparently in protest against a seemingly shoulder-high ball, arguing that it should have been called a no-ball.
Later a Bangladesh substitute who had come on to the field with drinks had become embroiled in an argument with the Sri Lankan players.
Meanwhile, a window of the visitors' dressing room was found damaged after Bangladesh's tense run chase against Sri Lanka. rnrnrnrn rnrnrnrnrnrn",cricket
"Darren Sammy hit 16 runs off the final over and ensure Peshawar Zalmi beat Quetta Gladiators by 5 wickets in a crucial Pakistan Super League encounter in Sharjah yesterday (Mar. 01). The Peshawar captain's heroics, hobbling out to bat on one leg, ensured he has taken pride of place on that shelf for the foreseeable future. Chasing 142, Peshawar had seemed on course for much of the innings, led by a disciplined - if a little sedate - 54-run partnership between Tamim Iqbal and Mohammad Hafeez. But with 35 required off the last five, the partnership was broken, and suddenly the chase went into disarray. The equation turned very quickly turned into 16 off the last 7 when Sammy, who was injured while bowling, dragged himself out to the crease. It turned out his devastating physical power was undiminished, as he smashed two sixes off his first two balls, before a straight drive in the final over saw Peshawar clinch victory with two balls to spare.

"Bangladesh national cricket selectors have recalled veteran left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak to the squad for the first of the two-match Test series against Sri Lanka. The first Test begins at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chittagong on Wednesday (Jan. 31). Razzak is the third player to be added to the squad after Shakib Al Hasan was ruled out of the match with an injury sustained during the tri-series final on Saturday. Razzak recently became the first Bangladeshi bowler to take 500 first-class wickets and has been the standout performer in Bangladesh in the format in the last few years. The 35-year-old's inclusion increases the size of the squad to 16 members, with the selectors having earlier called up left-arm spinner Sunzamul Islam and leg-spinning all-rounder Tanbir Hayder.

"South Africa have been dealt a huge blow with paceman Kagiso Rabada suspended for the final two matches of the ongoing Test series against Australia. Rabada was found guilty of deliberately making inappropriate contact with Australia captain Steve Smith on day one after an hour-long hearing with match referee Jeff Crowe at St George’s Park on Sunday night. Having been charged with a Level 2 breach of the ICC Code of Conduct, the 22-year-old was fined 50% of his match fee and handed three demerit points to take his total to eight, which equates to a two-Test ban. However, Cricket South Africa and Rabada have 48 hours to appeal the decision by the ICC, an option they are seeking legal counsel on whether to explore. If Rabada appeals he will remain suspended for the Cape Town Test unless a Judicial Commissioner is appointed early and hears an argument to allow him to complete whilst the hearing is being organized. After taking the wicket of Smith in the afternoon session on Friday, Rabada found himself in hot water when he brushed shoulders with the touring skipper as he moved to celebrate with his teammates. Crowe explained how he came to his decision in an ICC statement. ""I found that there was contact between Rabada and Smith, and in my judgement, the contact by Rabada was inappropriate and deliberate,"" Crowe said. ""He had the opportunity to avoid the contact, and I could not see any evidence to support the argument that the contact was accidental.",cricket
"Among all the allegations by Mohammed Shami's wife against him, the most damning one for the cricketer was his involvement with a Pakistani girl. Shami's wife Hasin Jahan alleged that the fast-bowler met a girl named Alishba in Dubai, after India's tour of South Africa, and also took money from her on the behest of a certain Mohammad bhai. Taking cognizance of Jahan's claims, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) launched an investigation to look for a possible match-fixing angle. Now, after much mud-slinging from both Shami and his wife over the past couple of weeks, Alishba has finally broken her silence. According to Alishba, her relationship with Shami started soon after India's defeat against Pakistan in the final of the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy in England. Shami had confronted a rude Pakistani fan in that match. The altercation made headlines and that's how Alishba got interested in the pacer. She contacted him on social media, and soon the duo became friends. ""I am one of his followers, which is how I became Shami's friend. Just like he has lakhs of followers, I am one among those normal fans. I have sent him messages,"" Alishba was quoted as saying by ABP News. ""As a person, I really like Shami. As any fan that has idolized a celebrity, they always dream of meeting their idol. I have a lot of respect for him and we became good friends. We had a normal conversation,"" she added. Shami's wife had earlier alleged that his husband has abused her physically and mentally on multiple occasions and has been involved in extra-marital affairs. A case was registered against Shami on the basis of a written complaint filed by her. In recent developments on the case, Shami told a media outlet that his wife has the passwords of all his social media accounts, hinting that she might have fabricated the evidence. ""Instead of issuing an apology to me in front of Bengal Police and media persons, he is trying to hide his mistakes with false accusations. What is the point of it when an investigation is already underway?"" Jahan reacted. On being asked if she was satisfied with the investigation, Jahan replied in the affirmative. (DNA)",cricket

"Ben Stokes produced a superb all-round performance in his second match back in the England fold to help level the ODI series and New Zealand. He helped seal a reasonably straightforward chase of 224 with a crisp 63 off 74 balls to follow two sharp run-outs, as part of an outstanding fielding display, and a brace of wickets. Stokes and Captain Eoin Morgan added 88 in 15 overs to break the back of the chase in Mount Maunganui's first day-night ODI. Stokes, playing increasingly fluently, reached his fifty from 54 balls and gave a muted raise of the bat around the ground, before finishing the task alongside Jos Buttler, who clubbed 36 off 20 balls. They won with more than more than 12 overs to spare. Batting first, New Zealand totalled 223 all out with Mitchell Santer top scoring with 63 not out. Martin Guptill made 50.

"Hours after Cricket Australia said it would investigate the actions of the Australian team's leadership in relation to the ball-tampering confession in the Cape Town Test, the Australian government has asked the board to remove Steven Smith as captain.
The country's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has also called the incident a ""shocking disappointment"". ""We all woke up this morning shocked and bitterly disappointed by the news from South Africa,"" Turnbull said.
""It seemed completely beyond belief that the Australian cricket team had been involved in cheating. ""I've spoken with David Peever, the Chairman of Cricket Australia, a few moments ago and I've expressed to him very clearly and unequivocally my disappointment and my concern about the events in South Africa”.
""It's their responsibility to deal with it, but I have to say that (to) the whole nation, who holds those who wear the Baggy Green up on a pedestal, about as high as you can get in Australia this is a shocking disappointment. It's wrong, and I look forward to Cricket Australia taking decisive action soon.""
The Australian Sports Commission (ASC) Chair John Wylie, the ASC Board, and CEO Kate Palmer - essentially speaking for the Australian government - called for severe action against the team.
""The ASC condemns cheating of any form in sport,"" it said in a statement.
""The ASC expects and requires that Australian teams and athletes demonstrate unimpeachable integrity in representing our country”.
""Given the admission by Australian captain Steve Smith, the ASC calls for him to be stood down immediately by Cricket Australia, along with any other members of the team leadership group or coaching staff who had prior awareness of, or involvement in, the plan to tamper with the ball. This can occur while Cricket Australia completes a full investigation.""
The government's point of view emerged shortly after CA chief executive James Sutherland had said the board would investigate the ball tampering affair and take further action against the national team beyond the ICC charge accepted by Cameron Bancroft.
With the CA chairman David Peever in transit home from South Africa, Sutherland chose not to travel to see the team himself, instead delegating the matter to the head of integrity, Iain Roy, and the team performance manager Pat Howard. The initiation of this ""process"" left Sutherland unable to offer anything beyond the conditional endorsement of Steven Smith as ""current"" captain of the national team.
Sutherland and Howard were central to the sacking of Mickey Arthur, the predecessor to the current coach Darren Lehmann, ahead of the 2013 Ashes series.
""This morning [Australian cricket fans] have every reason to wake up and not be proud of the Australian team. It's a sad day for Australian cricket,"" Sutherland said in Melbourne. ""Activities on the field yesterday in Cape Town are neither within the Laws of the game or within the spirit of the game. For us, at Cricket Australia that's extremely disappointing but more importantly, it's extremely disappointing for Australian cricket fans”.
Sutherland, who has been chief executive since 2001, revealed he was yet to speak to Smith about events at Newlands, where the Australians admitted to knowingly cheating by way of a ball-tampering attempt in South Africa's second innings.

"Twice Chris Gayle's name came up at the IPL auction, and twice he failed to get a bid. Just when it seemed like the highest-profile overseas player of the league over its first decade would not be part of the 2018 edition, Kings XI Punjab picked him up, triggering loud applause from all the other franchises in the room. Kings XI got Gayle at his base price, a mere INR 2 crore (USD 312,000 approx).Other high-profile players who benefited from a second chance were India opener M Vijay (INR 2 crore to Chennai Super Kings), wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel (INR 1.7 crore or USD 265,000 approx to Royal Challengers Bangalore), and Australia quick Mitchell Johnson (INR 2 crore to Kolkata Knight Riders), all of whom were bought when they were recalled on the second afternoon after going unsold the first time around. As per the regulations, any player who went unsold the first time - or second, as in Gayle's case - could be called up again, provided any of the franchises put in a request for the same.Though there have been 10 seasons of the IPL, it continues to keep throwing up firsts. Today that came in the form of Sandeep Lamichhane, the first player from Nepal to be picked in the auction. The 17-year old legspinner, who has played grade cricket in Sydney alongside former Australia captain Michael Clarke, was bought by the Delhi Daredevils for his base price of INR 20 lakh (USD 31000 approx).

Bangladesh is ravaged by injuries, with Tamim Iqbal (bicep) and Mushfiqur Rahim (wrist) having picked up niggles to add to Shakib's finger injury. In any case, they have to make five changes to the XI that played in their most recent T20I in October. If Tamim is fit, he will open with Soumya Sarkar. Among the newcomers, Afif Hossain, Ariful Haque and either one of Nazmul Islam or Mahedi Hasan are likely to make their debuts. A late injury to Asela Gunaratne, who landed awkwardly on his arm during a fielding training, has ruled him out of the series. This means Kusal Mendis - originally sent as a replacement for the injured Kusal Perera - could come into the side.

"Sri Lanka's Head Coach Chandika Hathurusingha says that he never doubted the team's ability after starting off his new coaching job with two successive defeats during the tour of Bangladesh. Sri Lanka had suffered three 5 nil whitewashes in ODI cricket in 2017 and the team's struggles continued in 2018 as they started off the tri-nation competition in Bangladesh last month with defeats to Zimbabwe and the hosts. Hathurusingha cited good communication, tactical flexibility, and a relaxed environment as key elements in Sri Lanka sweeping every trophy on offer. Now, his concentration has shifted to cultivating a strong squad that can compete in various conditions. ""We want a big pool of players for us to compete against different countries and different opposition, depending on their limitations and strengths,"" Hathurusingha said. ""All the players get an equal opportunity and they will definitely know where they stand when it comes to selection. Sri Lanka lost captain Angelo Mathews to injury at the start of the Bangladesh tour, but the team bounced back by winning the tri-nation finals before winning the Test and T20I series to complete a successful tour. ""With me, I don't think you will see the same team too often. Of course, the players that perform have the assurance of their places in the team, but will always try and see the best combination that can win games. It's not that we're trying to play with just eleven players for the next two years."" Jeevan Mendis provided a prime example of this policy in action. Drafted in after three years out of the national setup, he had an immediate impact, picking up two wickets in his first over.

"Cricket Australia has launched an investigation into the incident after a CCTV footage emerged, showing Australian vice-captain David Warner involving in a heated argument with South African wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock. The incident occurred at tea on day four of the first Test yesterday (Mar. 04). The incident occurred after two intriguing cricketing sessions. Warner was one of the focal points during the day following his animated celebration after the run-out of AB de Villiers. Australia also had a tough second session. They had managed just one wicket between lunch and tea with de Kock and Aiden Markram forging a partnership that revived the hosts’ bleak hopes of chasing down 417. And as the players left the field, emotions appeared to boil over. The footage showed Warner aggressively throwing verbal volleys at de Kock who was following the Australians up the steps. The Australian vice-captain was then held back from moving towards de Kock by Usman Khawaja and later Tim Paine. Captain Steven Smith then dragged his deputy in the dressing room, as de Kock headed towards his dressing room.

"Sri Lankan spinners outsmart Bangladeshi counterpartsThe curator at Mirpur may have prepared the pitch for the second Test thinking that home team's spinners would be able to throttle the Sri Lankan batsmen. However, the end result was quite the opposite. The 3-member Sri Lankan spin combination squeezed the home team's batsmen and they were bowled out for 110 and 123 runs in their respective innings.

"Chandimal, Hathurusinha, and Gurusinha suspended for two Tests and four ODI’s...
The independent Judicial Commissioner, Michael Beloff QC, has handed Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal, coach Chandika Hathurusinha and manager Asanka Gurusinha eight suspension points, which means the trio have also been suspended for the first four ODIs along with both the Tests against South Africa. The three were charged by the ICC Chief Executive David Richardson on 19 June and had pleaded guilty to breaching Level 3, Article 2.3.1, which relates to “conduct that is contrary to the spirit of the game”, during last month’s St Lucia Test against the West Indies. The Chairman of the ICC Code of Conduct Commission had held a hearing over video conference on Wednesday ( Jul 11), to determine the sanction, and, after more than six hours of the hearing, which was attended by legal counsels of both the sides, had reserved his decision. During the hearing, however, it was mutually agreed that, since the minimum sanction for a Level 3 offence was suspension from two Tests, the three will not participate in the Galle Test (played from 12-14 July) and Colombo Test (to be played from 20-24 July), and these will be credited against the sanction imposed by the Judicial Commissioner. As eight suspension points equate to a ban from two Tests and four ODIs/T20Is or eight ODIs/T20Is, whatever comes first for the player or player support personnel, the Judicial Commissioner’s ruling means the three will also remain suspended for the Dambulla ODIs (29th of July and 1st of August) as well as the Kandy ODIs (5th and 8th of August). Furthermore, six demerit points each have been added to the disciplinary records of Chandimal, Hathurusinghe and Gurusinha.",cricket
"New Zealander Luke Ronchi entertained cricket-starved fans in Karachi with a half-century as he anchored Islamabad United to a three-wicket win over defending champion Peshawar Zalmi in the Pakistan Super League final last night (Mar. 25). Islamabad, which won the inaugural PSL in the United Arab Emirates in 2016, raced to 154-7 in 16.5 overs with Ronchi hitting 52 off 26 balls, including five sixes and four boundaries.

"In a bizarre chain of events the Pakistan Super League game between Lahore Qalandars and Karachi Kings moved into the Super Over. In the end, the Lahore Qalandars prevailed over Karachi Kings in a nail-biting finish. After Lahore had made 11 in the Super Over, Karachi was halted in their tracks by Sunil Narine, who unleashed his full complement of tricks. Conceding only two runs off the first five balls, which included the wicket of Colin Ingram, Narine all but ensured Karachi didn't provide one last twist in an encounter that wouldn't pause for a moment of calm. Earlier in the night, Lahore experienced the full spectrum of emotions - they came within shouting distance of wrapping up the game but then thought they stuffed it only to eventually tie the game. Needing 16 to win off the last over, Sohail Akhtar turned up and dialled up the adrenaline with a sequence of 2, 4 and 6 off Usman Khan. With four runs needed off three deliveries, Mitchell McClenaghan ran himself out in pursuit of a bye. With the equation eventually narrowing down to three off one, Akhtar hit one straight down the throat of long on. However, even as Karachi were celebrating, it emerged that Usman had overstepped. More drama ensued as the two batsmen - Akhtar and Gulraiz Sadaf - hadn't completed the run. Despite the ball being ruled dead with Ravi Bopara, the fielder, having completed the catch before the run was completed, the umpires Aleem Dar and Tim Robinson ruled that Sadaf would be on strike for the last ball. With two needed off the final delivery, Usman nailed his yorker and Sadaf could manage only one as the game went into the Super Over. Just over a week ago, Lahore found themselves on the wrong side of a Super Over. This time they would prove to be second-time lucky.

"The knock of Dinesh Karthik in the Nidahas Trophy final has brought back the discussion on MS Dhoni's position in India's T20 team. Over the past year or so, MS Dhoni's position in India's side has been a subject of discussion. Cricket analysts say Dhoni was not able to score as quickly as he once did, and, besides, there is no World T20 scheduled before 2020, by when Dhoni will be 39. Dhoni hit 52 off 28 balls in the second T20I in South Africa, temporarily killing the debate, but the decision to rest him from the Nidahas Trophy gave Dinesh Karthik an opportunity to show the value he can bring to the Indian side.

"Bangladesh names squad for Sri Lanka Tests....Bangladesh Cricket Selectors have named their squad for the first Test against Sri Lanka to be played in Chittagong from 31st of this month. Under-19 off-spinner Nayeem Hasan is the surprise inclusion in the 14-man squad. Seventeen-year-old Nayeem is currently playing the Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand. His inclusion comes as a big surprise since Nayeem has played only four first-class matches and hasn't been mentioned in any selection conversations in the last few months. Chief selector Minhajul Abedin said that Nayeem will be returning from New Zealand to join the Test squad. The squad sees other major changes too. Shakib Al Hasan returned as captain after he was rested for the South Africa Tests last year while Mosaddek Hossain and Kamrul Islam were also recalled.

"Former Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene believes that despite not having two key players, the hosts are capable of lifting the Nidahas Trophy in Sri Lanka, the T20I tri-series also featuring India and Bangladesh. Sri Lanka will be without Angelo Mathews and Asela Gunaratne, while India has rested skipper Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya and Kuldeep Yadav. Writing in today’s Times of India, Jayawardene felt that Sri Lanka’s chances were good despite a perceived weakness in the bowling. “Given home advantage, growing confidence under Coach Chandika Hathurusingha, and the fact that India is not at full-strength, I think Sri Lanka can be fairly labelled as the favourites. But I would definitely not write off India who are blessed with strength in depth these days,” wrote Jayawardene, who played 448 ODIs, 149 ODIs and 55 T20Is. “It’s been an encouraging start to the year for this young Sri Lanka team under the stewardship of new coach Chandika Hathurusingha. We definitely had a year to forget in 2017 but there were some positive signs during the recent tour to Bangladesh, where the team completed an unexpected clean-sweep. This upturn in form and confidence makes the upcoming Nidahas Trophy very interesting indeed. It should be very competitive despite India resting some of their core players. The Indian young guns will be desperate to make an impression and Bangladesh will be striving to bounce back after their disappointing Sri Lanka tour.” According to Jayawardene, who retired from T20Is after Sri Lanka beat India in the final of the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, the lack of international experience in the home team’s bowling was a worry. “Suranga Lakmal, Nuwan Pradeep and Dushmantha Chameera are all inexperienced in this format. It’s going to be a real test of their skills and I am looking forward to seeing how they perform at critical high-pressure moments when it is very tough for the fast bowlers. The absence of Lasith, in particular, places extra pressure on the fast bowlers,” he wrote. India, led by Rohit Sharma in Kohli’s absence, has given opportunities to several fringe players in Washington Sundar, Rishabh Pant, Deepak Hooda, Vijay Shankar and Mohammad Siraj. Jayawardene understood the selectors’ decision to rest some of the big names given the IPL and tour of England that loom large. “It will be interesting to see what combination India go with today given the absence of most of their T20 stalwarts. The selectors will be excited about an opportunity to see some youngsters perform. Given a tough touring schedule and the IPL fast approaching, the decision to manage the workloads of some of their biggest stars is certainly understandable,” wrote the 40-year-old. “I would expect Sri Lanka to have requested good batting pitches, but with the current heat in Colombo, plus the fact that all matches are to be played at the Premadasa International Stadium, I think we will see the batsmen being challenged a little more than would be the case on typical sub-continental pitches. It should be a good balance between bat and ball.”",cricket
"South Africa beat Australia by six wickets in the second Test in Port Elizabeth to level the 4-match series one all. Chasing 101 to win, the home team reached the target losing 4 wickets in the 4th day afternoon. Kagiso Rabada who picked up 11 wickets was the Man of the Match. Earlier in the day, Australia resumed with a lead of 41 but the wicket of Mitch Marsh exposed Australia's bowlers to a rampant Rabada, who quickly dismissed Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc to make it 11 for the match. After bowling Marsh for 45 with a searing off-cutter in the first over of the day, Rabada then had a diving Theunis de Bruyn in the gully to thank for the wicket of Cummins (five). He then had Starc caught behind to continue the one-man wrecking show, before news filtered through that he had been charged by the ICC for a second offence in the match - this time for a day three send-off of David Warner. Fellow quick Lungi Nigidi then had Nathan Lyon (five) edging through to Quinton de Kock for his fifth wicket of the match, leaving a defiant Tim Paine and No.11 Josh Hazlewood with the task of scrounging out a slightly larger lead. Paine's unbeaten 28 and Hazlewood's run-a-ball 17 took the lead to exactly 100 before the paceman attempted one swipe too many from Keshav Maharaj and was caught near the midwicket boundary.

"Kagiso Rabada will play in the Cape Town Test after his two-match ban for making physical contact with Steven Smith was overturned by the ICC's code of conduct appeal commissioner Michael Heron. After a hearing via video conference lasting more than six hours on Monday, in which Rabada's case was championed by the high-profile South African legal advocate Dali Mpofu, his level 2 charge for physical contact was downgraded to a level 1 charge for conduct contrary to spirit of the game, with a 25% match fee fine and one demerit point, instead of the three he had initially been given by the match referee Jeff Crowe. This means Rabada's demerit points total dips below the threshold bringing an automatic ban, allowing him to play at Newlands. Rabada, the captain Faf du Plessis and the team manager Mohammed Moosajee all took part in the hearing. In his judgment, Heron said that he was not satisfied that Rabada's physical contact with Smith matched the ""inappropriate and deliberate"" definition covered by the ICC code of conduct. The incident took place in the first innings of the Port Elizabeth Test when Rabada made contact with Smith's shoulder after trapping him lbw. At that time, It handed him three demerit points, taking his total to eight within 24 months, which leads to a two-Test ban according to the ICC's rules.",cricket

"Ben Stokes has been stripped of the England vice-captaincy for the Test series against New Zealand with James Anderson retaining the role he took on during the Ashes. Though the appointment is currently being made on a series-by-series basis it seems likely that Anderson will keep the job at least until the conclusion of Stokes' court case. Stokes' trial date, after his charge of affray to which he has pleaded not guilty following the incident in Bristol last September, has been set for 6th of August and is expected to last between five and seven days, meaning the all-rounder will miss the Lord's Test against India. Having removed the vice-captaincy from him in the current situation it is very unlikely he will be considered again until the outcome of the legal case is known and also the Cricket Disciplinary Commission process that will follow.

"Iceland overcame massive odds to book a 1-1 draw against the fancied Portugese in Group F. Portugal had 72 percent of the ball and 26 shots on target. But in the end it was one goal apiece.
Portugal and superstar Cristiano Ronaldo came into the final first round match in St. Etienne as heavy favorites over Iceland, another major tournament debutante. But Iceland had looked good in qualifying, twice beating the Netherlands, and that had attracted considerable sympathy among neutrals.
And the northern Europeans almost started the match with a bang. Gylfi Sigurdsson had a clear look at goal but failed to get the ball past Rui Patricio.
After that it was all Portugal. Hannes Halldorsson was lucky to get a leg to a Nani header in minute 21, and Ronaldo failed to convert two good chances in the five minutes that followed.
On the hour mark, the Portugese struck pay dirt. Wolfsburg fullback Vieirinha started a move down the right flank, and André Gomes crossed to from the end line to Nani, who beat Halldorsson at the near post.
With the lead in hand and three-quarters of possession, Portugal eased off somewhat, and the score was 1-0 at the half.
There were no signs that that would change in the second half. Until minute 51, when the Portugese defense completely lost sight of Birkir Bjarnason. The Basel midfielder had no problem slamming home a Johann Gudmundsson.
Portugal resumed probing in an effort to restore their lead, but Iceland had plugged most of their defensive holes and had the odd half-chance themselves, including what must have been one of the longest throw-ins in history with a quarter of an hour to go.
In the final minutes Iceland had to repel waves upon waves of Portugese attacks, with their fanatic supporters cheering every clearance as if it were a winning goal. Five minutes from time, Ronaldo had a header from point-blank range, but Halldorsson, who plays for a relegation-threatened club in Norway, just managed to keep the ball out.
At the other end Alfred Finnbogason of Augsburg had a chance at an absolute sensation one minute later, but Patricio displayed sharp reflexes. Renaldo had a pair of free kicks in the dying seconds, but it was no dice for the Real Madrid scoring machine and pin-up. Iceland celebrated a 1-1 draw that must have felt like Christmas and a handful of birthdays all in one.
Portugal, on the other hand, were understandably disappointed.
""I hope this a signal for us that we have to put our games away,"" Nani said after the match.
Iceland will meet Hungary on Saturday, while Portugal will attempt take out their frustration on Austria.

"England came into Thursday's match in Lens with plenty of motivation. After conceding a late equalizer on Saturday against Russia and facing their neighbors Wales, three points were vital.
Manager Roy Hodgson went with an unchanged lineup from the side that drew with Russia. Wales were boosted by the return of first-choice goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey, while Hal Robson-Kanu, who scored last week's winner against Slovakia off the bench, started up front.
The Three Lions boasted the superior side on paper, and they controlled possession accordingly. Their best chance of the first half came inside the first ten minutes. Racing down the left wing, Adam Lallana sent a well-placed cross to Raheem Sterling, but the Manchester City attacker connected with his weaker left foot, and skied his shot over the bar.
England fans were then understandably upset when German referee Felix Brych failed to call Ben Davies handball in the box in the 32nd minute.
Instead, it was Wales who took the lead before haltime. With minutes to go until the break, Gareth Bale launched a well-placed free kick roughly 30 meters from goal over the wall that dipped into the near corner. Keeper Joe Hart could only push it into the side netting, as Wales took a 1-0 lead.
Hodgson reacted accordingly, bringing on strikers Jamie Vardy and Daniel Sturridge for Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane respectively to start the second half.
It took just ten minutes for the plan to pay off. Sturridge sent a ball into the box that Wales captain Ashley Williams knocked down into the path of Vardy. The Leicester City striker was left with an easy tap-in for the equalizer.
The goal put the momentum firmly on England's side. The Three Lions piled on the pressure as the clock ticked towards 90 minutes.
Sturridge finally got on the scoreboard himself in injury time. Dele Ali's pass found the Liverpool striker in the area, and he fired home from close range for the winner.
After questions around his side selection against Slovakia, Hodgson's clever substitutions delivered England's first victory of the tournament. The 2-1 victory puts his side on a good course for the round of 16 with four points after two matches.
Group B play wraps up on Monday, with England taking on Slovakia, while Wales face Russia.

Italy nearly doubled their advantage five minutes later when Belgium failed to clear their lines following a corner, but Pelle headed the ball just wide of the post from six yards.
Belgium pushed back before the break as Marouane Fellaini played in Kevin De Bruyne, but Giaccherini tracked back to get his foot to the Manchester City man's shot.
After half-time, Belgium nearly equalized on the counter-attack as Romelu Lukaku's first-time shot curled inches past the post.
There were clear chances for both sides as the match drew to a close but it was Antonio Conte's men who had the last word, with Antonio Candreva crossing for Pelle to smash home following a counter attack.
Gerard Pique scored a late goal as defending champions Spain began their campaign with a 1-0 win against a stubborn Czech Republic side.
The Group D match had seemed set to end in a goalless draw despite plenty of Spain pressure, but Pique sealed the points when he headed home a fine Andres Iniesta cross three minutes from time.
Czech Republic keeper Petr Cech was called upon to make a succession of saves during the match, although David De Gea in the Spain goal also had to be alert.
Spain began to apply heavy pressure as the game drew towards a close and got their reward when Iniesta set up his Barcelona teammate for a deserved winner.
Republic of Ireland were denied victory over Sweden in Group E by a Ciaran Clark own goal in a 1-1 draw at the Stade de France.
Ireland were far brighter during the first half, and they came close to the opening goal when Derby midfielder Jeff Hendrick curled a superb shot against the crossbar.
The second half began at a thrilling pace, and Ireland -- having just seen Hendrick go close again -- took the lead through Wes Hoolahan's neat finish on 48 minutes, firing in a curling shot on the bounce from Seamus Coleman's cross.
Sweden improved after the goal, and they drew level on 71 minutes when Zlatan Ibrahimovic latched onto John Guidetti's neat flick and then sent in a cross that Clark headed past Darren Randolph at the near post.Scroll down to watch the video

"Barcelona football star Lionel Messi and his father will appeal against a Spanish court decision to sentence them each to 21 months in jail for tax fraud, the player's lawyers say.
Argentine Messi, aged 29, was also fined €2m euros (£1.7m; $2.2m) by the court in Barcelona.
In addition to the prison term, Messi's father, Jorge, was fined €1.5m for defrauding Spain of €4.1m in 2007-09.
However, neither man is expected to serve time in jail.
Under the Spanish legal system, prison terms of under two years can be served under probation.
The pair also face millions of euros in fines for using tax havens in Belize and Uruguay to conceal earnings from image rights.
""The sentence is not correct and we are confident the appeal will show the defence was right,"" Messi's lawyers said in a statement several hours after the guilty verdict was delivered.
The lawyers said that ""there is a good chance that the appeal will succeed"", adding that Messi had always acted in good faith.
The sentence can be appealed against via the Spanish Supreme Court.
The footballer and his father were found guilty of three counts of tax fraud.",football
"24 teams battle it out for a place in knockout stages of Euro 2016. There are six groups and there will be four best third placed sides that will progress to the next stage as well.
The result have followed quite a familiar pattern in Euro 2016 so far and it was hosts France who got the ball rolling with a win in the opening game of the tournament, beating Romania 2-1 in the dying minutes of the game through Dimitri Payet’s strike. In Group B, England had done everything except win their tournament opener against Russia. Wayne Rooney’s distribution in the game as first-rate and the men alongside him — Delle Alli, Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling were all excellent but failed to convert that to goals. Eric Dier scored a cracker of a free-kick but it was cancelled out by the Russian skipper in the dying minutes of the game.
Before England got their game underway, Switzerland scored early against Albania in what was quite a feisty encounter between both the sides. The Swiss would go on to protect their lead in the game and registered three points on the board. Then came Wales and Gareth Bale, who left it late. Bale had scored first but Slovakia drew level in the game. In the final few minutes, Hal Robson-Kanu ran in and tapped the ball in through a scrambled effort and the Welsh had created history. Germany and Ukraine, for the first half atleast, played what was an enthralling battle. The Ukrainians, for all their efforts, had nothing to show at the end of it and the Germans walked away with three points on the board. The 15th edition of the European Championships is held in France and this time, the tournament, Euro 2016 will be expanded to 24 teamsa and has certain changes to the format that was prevelant till the last European Championships. The teams will be divided into six groups with four teams each and the top two teams will progress to the knockout stages of the tournament. Apart from those 12 teams, 4 of the best third placed sides will also progress to the next stage. The points scoring system remains the same; 3 for a win 1 for a draw and 0 for a loss.

"Afghanistan downed Sri Lanka 5-0 at the Trivandrum International Stadium, Kerala to book their berth in the finals of the SAFF Championship where they shall face the Indian challenge.
Goals from Mohammed Hashami (46’), Kanischka Taher (50’), Khaibar Amani (55’), Ahmad Hatifie (78’) and Faysal Shayesteh (89’) were enough to continue their unbeaten run into the finals.
Afghanistan coach Petr Segrt made as many as seven changes to the line-up which started against Maldives. The likes of Norlla Amiri, Mustafa Hadid, Kanischka Taher and others made their way into the first eleven.
Sampath Perera made three changes to the team which suffered 2-0 defeat at the hands of India. Mohammed Hakeem, Mohammmed Rifnas and Kavindu Ishan were named in the starting line-up.
It was the Lankans who had a chance to take the lead in the third minute. Nipuna Bandara got beyond the Afghan defence but a soft touch inside the box allowed the goalkeeper to avert the danger.
Midway through the first half, Kanischka played a looping ball which needed to be guided in but Popalzay couldn’t connect.
The deadlock was broken in the injury time. A long ball from the right was headed across by Masih Saighani which was slotted home by Mohammed Hashami.
It took five minutes into the second half for Afghanistan to double their lead. Amiri plays a through-ball for Popalzay who laid it back for Kanischka. The 24-year-old slammed his shot into the back of the net.
Afghanistan were awarded a penalty five minutes later when Mohamed Hakeem brought down Popalzay. Khaibar Amani successfully converted from the spot to score his fourth goal in the competition.
Sri Lanka had a chance to pull one back in the 69th minute. Zohar Zarwan’s free-kick was deflected and the eventual shot from Gnanaruban was kept out by Ovays Azizi.
Ahmad Hatifie added his name on the score-sheet. Kanischa’s free-kick found Hatifie in space who connected his header to make it 4-0 for the Afghans.
The fifth goal came in the 89th minute. Popalzay found Zazai who opted to play it back for skipper Faysal Shayesteh whose left footed curled gave the goalkeeper no chance to make a save whatsoever.
The score-line remained the same until the final whistle as Afghanistan, who have scored 16 goals in their four games in this edition of the SAFF Championship, come up against India on Sunday in what promises to be an enthralling final.

"Argentina is facing the prospect of an early World Cup exit after a dreadful error from goalkeeper Willy Caballero set Croatia on their way to victory and a place in the last 16. On a night when so much was expected of Argentina captain Lionel Messi, Caballero made the most telling contribution to his team's fate with an attempted chip over Ante Rebic that backfired badly, allowing the striker to volley into an exposed net in the 53rd minute. Messi - adrift for much of the match, especially during a pedestrian opening half - rallied his side, but neither he nor substitute forwards Gonzalo Higuain and Pablo Dybala could find a way through in Nizhny Novgorod. The closest Messi came was a half-chance, a snatch at a rebound from a Maximiliano Meza shot which was blocked by Ivan Rakitic and turned behind to safety. It was a dogged defensive second-half display from Croatia, illuminated by a moment of magic from their own masterful number 10, Luka Modric. His curled shot from range drifted beautifully beyond Caballero's gloves to put his side two ahead before Rakitic's injury-time tap-in sealed a victory that moves the Europeans through to the knockout stage and also leaves them in a strong position to win the group. Argentina is no longer in control of their own destiny. This defeat follows their opening 1-1 draw with Iceland, in which Messi missed a penalty, and now even a heavy win over Nigeria in their final game on Tuesday may not be enough to send them through to the next round. Should Iceland beat Nigeria in their second Group D game on Friday, Iceland would need only a draw against Croatia in their final match. For Messi, a prolific performer at club level with Barcelona, this was another harrowing chapter in his recent history of pain and disappointment in the international game.rn rnIn another game, France defeated Peru and with this defeat, Peru will be eliminated from the Fifa World Cup. rn rnIn the first game of yesterday, Denmark drew with Australia 1 all.rn

"Bruno Soriano's spectacular second-half goal gave Villarreal a 1-0 win over Valencia in a La Liga contest at the Estadio El Madrigal.
With this win on Thursday, Villarreal, with 33 points from 17 matches, move up to fourth place, two ahead of Celta Vigo and three behind Real Madrid. Still without a win under new coach Gary Neville, Valencia sit in 10th place with 22 points.
Deployed in a 3-5-2 formation, the visitors largely ceded the initiative to the home team, who put on an impressive display but failed to mount any serious threat to the goal protected by Valencia's Jaume Domenech, reports Efe.
The hosts' only real opportunity of the first half came on a free kick by Soriano, whose shot sailed harmlessly outside the post.
Valencia looked like a different squad for the first 15 minutes of the second half, dominating the flow of play and creating a trio of legitimate chances.
But just when Villarreal appeared to be in real trouble, a foul on Soldado on the edge of the area set up another free kick by Soriano, who sent the ball past Domenech into the top left corner of the net.

"France are a team that keeps their supporters' hearts in throats. On Wednesday minnows Albania stymied them for 89 minutes. Then just when a draw looked inevitable, a substitute finally broke the ice in a 2-0 win.
Albania were hoping to open their points account in Marseilles, while hosts France had the chance to cruise into the knock-out phase of Euro 2016. French coach Didier Deschamps opted for some rotation, starting N'Golo Kanté and Bayern wunderkind Kingsley Coman ahead of stars Antoine Griezmann and Paul Pogba.
Les Bleus had the first sniff of a goal after only three-and-a-half minutes. But striker Olivier Giroud couldn't control his short-range header after a free kick. Albania - the tournament's biggest long-shots - weren't content just to park the bus, showing enough attacking ambition to prevent the French from setting up camp in their half.
The Albanian defense also kept the hosts' attackers under control with surprising ease. By the half-hour mark, France had only gotten off three shots. At the other end, the Albanians came close in minute 38 after a deflected corner kick. And an Albanian free kick one minute before the break only went over the cross bar by inches.
All in all, it was not just down to luck that the match was scoreless at half-time.
Deschamps brought on Pogba for the ineffectual Anthony Martial, and Coman nearly got France on track 30 seconds into the new half, but his header went agonizingly wide.
Six minutes on, Albania were even closer to taking the lead when Kanté diverted the ball onto his own post and Ledian Memushaj couldn't get the ball over the line. It was a mark of France's frustration that by the hour mark, the favorites - in particular Pogba and Dimitri Payet - were trying their luck with shots from distance.
More promising was a short cross from Kanté to Giroud in minute 66, but the forward directed the ball well wide. Only two minutes later, Giroud was desperately unlucky only to hit the post on another header. Albania breathed a sigh of relief.
In minute 81, Giroud's Arsenal teammate Laurent Koscielny had the chance to go him one better but failed to get his head on a tailor-made free kick. Would France be able to manufacture another last-ditch winner, as they had in their opener?
The answer was: oui. With one minute left in regular time, 1.75-meter-tall substitute Griezmann finally angled a header past keeper Etrit Berisha and unleashed positive pandemonium in Marseilles. Payet showed his quality in the fifth minute of injury time, curling in a shot to complete the 2-0 scoreline.
The win means that France have qualified for the next round from group A, while Albanian need a result against Romania this Sunday. France will try to win the group outright against Switzerland. (DW)",football

"Uefa president Michel Platini will resign from European football's governing body after failing to have a six-year ban from football overturned.
A Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) panel reduced the ban to four years on Monday.
Following the judgement, the 60-year-old said he would be stepping down.
Platini and former Fifa counterpart Sepp Blatter, were last year found guilty of ethics breaches over a 2m Swiss Franc (£1.3m) ""disloyal payment"".
The pair, who deny wrongdoing, had their original bans reduced from eight to six years by the Fifa appeals committee.
Platini had taken his case to Cas seeking to get the ban overturned, but a three-man panel said it ""was not convinced by the legitimacy of the payment"".
The two said the payment in 2011 was made for consultancy work Platini had carried out for Blatter between 1998 and 2002, and that they had a ""gentleman's agreement"" on when the balance was settled.
The matter is also being looked into by Swiss prosecutors.
After Cas returned its judgement, Platini said in a statement: ""I am resigning from my duties as Uefa president to pursue my battle in front of the Swiss courts to prove my innocence in this case.""
He added that he considered the judgement ""a profound injustice"".
However, the Cas panel was damning of Platini, saying his ""behaviour was not ethical or loyal"".
It found his dealings with Blatter had breached the ethics code of world governing body Fifa, and while his six-year ban was ""too severe"", it decided a four-year punishment should be handed down - the equivalent to a presidential term in office.
It also said an 80,000 Swiss Franc (£57,200) fine should be lowered to 60,000 (£42,900), but stressed: ""The Cas panel was of the opinion that a severe sanction could be justified in view of the superior functions carried out by Mr Platini (Fifa vice-president and Uefa president), the absence of any repentance and the impact that this matter has had on Fifa's reputation.""
Uefa said it would meet on 18 May ""to discuss next steps"", foreign media reports.

"Wales qualified for the knockout stages of the European Championship as a group winner after it overwhelmed Russia 3-0 on Monday and England could only grind out a 0-0 draw with Slovakia.
In its first international tournament since the 1958 World Cup, Wales ended Group B with six points, one ahead of England, which also qualifies for the round of 16. With four points on the board, Slovakia still has a chance to make it to the knockout stages as one of the best third-place teams.
Wales was dominant against a disappointing Russia side, producing an impressive counterattacking display that rested on more than just its talisman, Gareth Bale, the tournament's top scorer after three goals in three matches.
""As a nation geographically we are small, but if you judge us by passion you could say we were a continent tonight,"" Wales coach Chris Coleman said.
""These players keep delivering moments that I think they're not going to top, and they've done it again tonight in all fairness.""
Next up for Wales, once the other group matches have been completed, will be a team that finished its group in third-place.
While Coleman will prepare for the last 16, Russia coach Leonid Slutsky gave a strong hint that he won't be at the helm for much longer as the country readies to host the 2018 World Cup.
""I think after a type of tournament like this, you need someone else to take charge of the national side for major competitions,"" he said via a translator. Frustration for England For England, there was frustration about its failure to top the group especially after it had come from behind to beat Wales 2-1 in its previous game.
Coach Roy Hodgson took a gamble in team selection by dropping six players from the victory over Wales, including Captain Wayne Rooney.
The gamble failed to pay off, even though his team kept the pressure up throughout the game and managed 30 shots. Slovakia, knowing a point could be enough to advance, rarely played in England's final third.
""Finishing second is a disappointment,"" Hodgson conceded. ""But we are still in the last 16 and who is to say the team we will play will be that much stronger? You just don't know. The way we are playing, I am not frightened of anybody.""
The final round of group matches continues with four matches on Tuesday.
In Group C, Ukraine, which has already been knocked out of Euro 2016, takes on Poland in Marseille, while Northern Ireland meets world champion Germany at the Parc des Princes in Paris.
In Group D, the Czech Republic meets Turkey in Lens while Croatia takes on two-time defending champion and already-qualified Spain in Bordeaux. (CBC Sports reports)

"Austria, who were undefeated in their 10 qualifying games, lost 2-0 to long-standing rivals Hungary in the opening match of Euro 2016 Group F on Tuesday.
The Hungarians, who only reached the finals through the playoffs, took the lead with a rare goal by forward Adam Szalai in the 62nd minute -- his first at international level since October 2014.
Austria thought they had equalised soon after but Martin Hinteregger's effort was disallowed for a foul by Aleksandar Dragovic who was sent off after receiving a second yellow card.
Substitute Zoltan Stieber secured victory three minutes from the end.
In front of two of the noisiest sets of supporters yet seen at the tournament, Austria were the better side in the first half.
David Alaba, the country's player of the year in 2015 for the fifth time in succession, looked as though he could be the game's dominant figure from the first minute when he burst forward and hit a fierce drive against the post from 20 metres.
Goalkeeper Gabor Kiraly, the first 40-year-old to play at a European Championship, was beaten on that occasion but made an excellent save from Zlatko Junuzovic 10 minutes before halftime.
Despite Zoltan Gera's long crossfield passes that were opening up play, Hungary were restricted to shots from distance until Laszlo Kleinheisler handed their only real first-half chance to captain Balazs Dzsudzsak who pulled it across goal.
The game then turned on two incidents within as many minutes just after the hour.
Szalai, nobody's idea of a prolific scorer, took a return pass from Kleinheisler and slid the ball past previously untroubled goalkeeper Robert Almer.
Austria retaliated almost immediately as Hinteregger's shot beat Kiraly but the referee ruled it out for a late tackle by Dragovic who had been yellow-carded in the first half.
Two substitutes combined late in the game to clinch an unexpected victory in the 137th meeting between the two sides dating back to 1902.
Tamas Priskin, who had replaced scorer Szalai, sent Stieber racing through to grab the second goal in front of thousands of delighted Hungarians.
Once a sizeable force in world football, the team have been in the doldrums for a long while.

"Cristiano Ronaldo continued his sensational start to the World Cup with the winner as Portugal knocked Morocco out of the tournament. All eyes at the Luzhniki Stadium were on the Real Madrid star after his hat-trick in Portugal's opening game with Spain and, typically, he did not disappoint. It took the captain only four minutes to make his mark in the way Morocco had feared, diving to get on the end of a Joao Moutinho cross and planting an unstoppable header into the net. Ronaldo's goal put the European champions briefly top of Group B and extended his lead as the top scorer in Russia in the race for the Golden Boot. Spain's 1-0 win over Iran, means they top the group courtesy of having collected fewer disciplinary points than Portugal. Morocco, who last week failed in their bid to host the 2026 World Cup, became the first team to be eliminated from this one with one Group B game to go - but they did not go down without a fight.

"Japan profited from Colombia's nightmare start to the World Cup as they secured a victory against 10 men in their Group H opener in Saransk, despite James Rodriguez's late introduction. Colombia conceded a penalty and had a man sent off inside three minutes, with Carlos Sanchez dismissed for handling Shinji Kagawa's shot at a goal left exposed by terrible defending. After the first red card shown at this World Cup - and the second fastest in history at two minutes 56 seconds - Kagawa scored the spot-kick. Japan should have increased their lead soon after as Takashi Inui and Yuya Osako wasted fine openings. They were punished when Juan Quintero's clever free-kick, fired low under the jumping wall, brought Jose Pekerman's Colombia on level terms six minutes before the break. Colombia had never come back to win a World Cup match in which they had conceded the opening goal - across 10 games - and star player Rodriguez was brought on in the second half, not having been deemed fit enough to start. However, it was Japan who regained the lead, Osako finishing with a header from Keisuke Honda's corner. Rodriguez had been struggling to leave a mark on the game, with Japan, at last, making their extra man count and dominating possession as might be expected, but there would be one big chance late on. Freed into space after a clever backheel, Rodriguez's blistering strike from inside the box was deflected over the bar by a brave lunge from Osako. This was the first time Japan had won a World Cup game on European soil, and the first time they had beaten a side from South America at the tournament. For Colombia, who reached the quarter-finals in 2014, this was a miserable defeat that leaves them with two very important games against Poland and Senegal to come.

An own goal from Levante defender David Navarro and an injury time goal from Luis Suarez allowed FC Barcelona take three points despite a below par display away to bottom of the table Levante on Sunday, reports Xinhua.
Barcelona had the ball in the back of the net as early as the second minute but Lionel Messi's strike from an Iniesta pass was wrongly ruled out for offside. However, they had a stroke of good fortune when Navarro deflected Jordi Alba's cross into his own net midway through the half.
The home side reacted and were unlucky when Luis Morales' shot hit the post and it was not until the last move of the game that Barcelona assured the points when Suarez netted his 20th league goal of the campaign on the break as Levante pressed for an equaliser.
